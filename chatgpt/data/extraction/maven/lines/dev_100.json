By the end of the era east-central Minnesota had replaced northern Minnesota as the economic center of the area.. This era was also as a period of cultural transition.. At the time the U.S. took possession of the region, Native Americans were by far the largest ethnic groups.. Their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the French, British, and Americans asserted territorial claims on the area.. French and British traders had mixed with native society in the area for many decades peacefully contributing to the society and creating new ethnic groups consisting of mixed-race peoples.. As the Americans established outposts in the area and the fur trade declined, the dynamics changed dramatically.. The economic influence of the Native Americans diminished and American territorial ideology increasingly sought to limit their influence.. Large waves of immigration in the 1850s very suddenly changed the demographics so that within a few years the population shifted from predominantly native to predominantly people of European descent.. The native and mixed-race populations continued to influence the territory's culture and politics, even at the end of the territorial era, though by the time statehood was achieved that influence was in steep decline..

      "context": "Madrid was held by various forces loyal to the Spanish Republic and was besieged and subject to aerial bombardment by the rebel faction under General Francisco Franco.. The Battle of Madrid in November 1936 saw the most intense fighting in and around the city when the Nationalists made their most determined attempt to take the Republican capital.. The highest military awards of the Spanish Republic, the Laureate Plate of Madrid () and the Madrid Distinction (), established by the Republican government in order to reward courage, were named after the capital of Spain owing to the city symbolizing valour and Antifascist resistance during the long siege throughout the Civil War.. Uprising — Madrid held for the Republic (July 1936).. The Spanish Civil War began with a failed \"coup d'état\" against the Popular Front Government of the Spanish Republic by right-wing Spanish Army officers on 18 July 1936.. In Madrid, the Republican government was unsure of what to do.. It wanted to put down the coup, but was unsure if it could trust the armed forces and did not want to arm the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade unions and potentially accelerate the ongoing Spanish revolution.. On 18 July, the government sent units of the Guardia Civil to Seville to put down the rebellion there.. However, on reaching the city the guardias defected to the insurgents.. On 19 July Santiago Casares Quiroga resigned as Prime Minister, to be succeeded by Diego Martinez Barrio.. He tried to arrange a truce with the insurgent general Emilio Mola by telephone, but Mola refused the offer and Martinez Barrio was ousted as Prime Minister by José Giral.. Giral agreed to arm the trade unionists in defence of the Republic, and had 60,000 rifles delivered to the CNT and UGT headquarters, although only 5,000 were in working order.. In a radio broadcast on the 18th, the communist leader Dolores Ibarruri coined the famous slogan \"¡No pasarán!\". (\"They shall not pass\"), urging resistance against the coup.. The slogan was to become synonymous with the defence of Madrid and the Republican cause in general.. At the same time, General Joaquín Fanjul, commander of the military garrison based in Montaña barracks in Madrid, was preparing to launch the military rebellion in the city.. However, when he tried to march out of the barracks, his 2,500 troops were forced back inside the compound by hostile crowds and armed trade unionists.. On the 20th, the barracks was stormed by a mixture of workers and \"Guardias de Asalto\" (\"assault guards\", an urban police force) loyal to the government, as well as five battalions of the Communist-led Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias (MAOC) —one of these battalions became the famous \"Fifth Regiment\"— totaling about 10,000 fighters.. The fighting was chaotic, and on several occasions some soldiers within the barracks indicated their willingness to surrender, only for other troops to keep firing at the attackers, killing those who had broken cover to take them prisoner.. Eventually the barracks fell when the \"Guardias de Asalto\" brought up a 75 mm field gun to bombard the complex and its gate was opened by a sapper sergeant sympathetic to the Republican side.. The sergeant was killed by one of his officers, but his action allowed the Republicans to breach the walls.. A number of soldiers were massacred by the crowd, enraged by the apparent false surrenders, after the fall of the barracks.. Thereafter and for the remainder of the war, Madrid was held by the Republicans.. However, its population contained a significant number of right-wing sympathisers.. Over 20,000 right-wingers sought refuge in foreign embassies in the city.. The weeks that followed the July uprising, saw a number of so-called fascists or fascist sympathisers being killed in Madrid by Republicans.. For example, on 23 August 70 prisoners from the \"Modelo\" Prison in the city were massacred in revenge for the Nationalist killing of over 1,500 Republicans after the storming of Badajoz.. Nationalist \"Drive on Madrid\" (August–October 1936).. The initial strategy of the military plot had been to assume power all over the country in the manner of a \"Pronunciamiento\" (military coup) of the 19th century.. However, the resistance to the coup by Republicans meant that instead of this, Franco and his allies would have to conquer the country by military force if they wanted to seize power.. Franco himself had landed in Algeciras in southern Spain with Moroccan troops from the Spanish Army of Africa.. Mola, who was in command of the colonial troops as well as the Spanish Foreign Legion and Carlist and Falangist militia, raised troops in the north.. Together, they planned a \"Drive on Madrid\" to take the Spanish capital, Franco advancing from Badajoz, which he took in August and Mola from Burgos.. Franco's veteran colonial troops, or \"regulares\", under General Yague, along with air cover supplied by Nazi Germany, routed the Republican militias in their path.. Yague argued for a rapid advance on Madrid, but Franco overruled him in favour of relieving the Nationalist troops besieged in Toledo.. This diversion held up their attack on Madrid by up to a month — giving the Republicans time to prepare its defence.. Meanwhile, in the city, the Republican government had reformed under the leadership of socialist leader Francisco Largo Caballero.. Caballero's government included six Socialist party ministers, two Communists, two from the Republican Left party, one from the Catalan Left party, one Basque Nationalist Party and one Republican Union minister.. Although the communists were a minority in the government, they gained in influence through their access to arms from the USSR and foreign volunteers in the International Brigades.. The Republican military commander in Madrid was nominally a Spanish general, Jose Miaja, but Soviet military personnel were perhaps more important.",

It took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War, which left much of the Russian Army in a state of mutiny..

The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, resulting in the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II.. Grassroots community assemblies called 'Soviets', which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias.. A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of Soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class.. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and strikes..

The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely..
