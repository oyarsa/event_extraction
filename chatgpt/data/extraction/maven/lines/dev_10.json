Notes: The order of appearance on this bill was TKO/Hagar/Nazareth/Van Halen/Boston/Heart/BOC.. Blue Oyster Cult headlined this show.. TKO was managed by the same management as Heart at the time, which is the reason for their appearance on the bill.. KTXQ-FM Q-102 simulcast much of this concert throughout the day, with TKO, Hagar, Nazareth, and portions of Heart's show aired live.. Van Halen's set was not broadcast, and KTXQ had to unplug their sound equipment for Boston's set, which they did before Heart took the stage.. As a result, only a portion of Heart's set was aired, the sound being broadcast from microphones placed around the Cotton Bowl.. Officially called \"The Last Concert of the Last Weekend of the Last Summer of the Seventies\",  Note: Rush performed pre-studio versions of \"The Spirit of Radio\" and \"Freewill\".. Notes: Savvy was bumped at the last minute by The Eagles management.. Show lineup confirmed by Steve Jones of Savvy.. Christopher Cross, who already didn't fit on the hard rocking Texxas Jam stage, was resoundingly booed at the outset of \"Sailing\", then later cut his set short after throwing up on stage due to heat exhaustion.",

      "context": "Saw mills, and later grain mills, around Fort Snelling and Saint Anthony Falls in east-central Minnesota became magnets for development.. By the end of the era east-central Minnesota had replaced northern Minnesota as the economic center of the area.. This era was also as a period of cultural transition.. At the time the U.S. took possession of the region, Native Americans were by far the largest ethnic groups.. Their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the French, British, and Americans asserted territorial claims on the area.. French and British traders had mixed with native society in the area for many decades peacefully contributing to the society and creating new ethnic groups consisting of mixed-race peoples.. As the Americans established outposts in the area and the fur trade declined, the dynamics changed dramatically.. The economic influence of the Native Americans diminished and American territorial ideology increasingly sought to limit their influence.. Large waves of immigration in the 1850s very suddenly changed the demographics so that within a few years the population shifted from predominantly native to predominantly people of European descent.. The native and mixed-race populations continued to influence the territory's culture and politics, even at the end of the territorial era, though by the time statehood was achieved that influence was in steep decline.. Heavy immigration from New England and New York led to Minnesota's being labeled the \"New England of the West\".",

Among the dead was French Guianan politician and war hero Justin Catayée and poet and black-consciousness activist Paul Niger..
