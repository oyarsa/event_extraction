    "context": "Of 127,000 Japanese Americans living in the continental United States at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, 112,000 resided on the West Coast.. About 80,000 were \"Nisei\" (literal translation: \"second generation\"; American-born Japanese with U.S. citizenship) and \"Sansei\" (\"third generation\"; the children of Nisei).. The rest were \"Issei\" (\"first generation\") immigrants born in Japan who were ineligible for U.S. citizenship under U.S. law.. Japanese Americans were incarcerated based on local population concentrations and regional politics.. More than 110,000 Japanese Americans living on the West Coast were forced into interior camps.. However, in Hawaii, where 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were also interned.. The internment is considered to have resulted more from racism than from any security risk posed by Japanese Americans.. Those who were as little as Japanese, orphaned infants, and anyone with—in the words of the architect behind the internment program, Colonel Karl Bendetsen—\"one drop of Japanese blood\" were placed in the internment camps.. Roosevelt authorized the deportation and incarceration with Executive Order 9066, issued on February 19, 1942, which allowed regional military commanders to designate \"military areas\" from which \"any or all persons may be excluded.\". This authority was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were required to leave Alaska and the military exclusion zones from all of California and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, except for those in government camps.. Approximately 5,000 Japanese Americans relocated outside the exclusion zone before March 1942, while some 5,500 community leaders had been arrested immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack and thus were already in custody.",

Eventually, it employed terror bombing on areas of political significance and on civilians.. The Germans had rapidly overwhelmed France and the Low Countries, leaving Britain to face the threat of invasion by sea.. The German high command knew the difficulties of a seaborne attack and its impracticality while the Royal Navy controlled the English Channel and the North Sea.. On 16 July, Adolf Hitler ordered the preparation of Operation Sea Lion as a potential amphibious and airborne assault on Britain, to follow once the Luftwaffe had air superiority over the UK.. In September, RAF Bomber Command night raids disrupted the German preparation of converted barges, and the Luftwaffe's failure to overwhelm the RAF forced Hitler to postpone and eventually cancel Operation Sea Lion.. Germany proved unable to sustain daylight raids, but their continued night-bombing operations on Britain became known as the Blitz.. Historian Stephen Bungay cited Germany's failure to destroy Britain's air defences to force an armistice (or even outright surrender) as the first major German defeat in World War II and a crucial turning point in the conflict.. The Battle of Britain takes its name from a speech given by Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the House of Commons on 18 June: \"What General Weygand called the 'Battle of France' is over.",

After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October 16 and then to hurricane status on October 17.. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985.. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas.. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed.. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October 27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain.. Early in its duration, Lili caused flooding in Central America that left thousands homeless and killed 14 people.",
