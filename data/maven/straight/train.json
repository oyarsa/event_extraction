The victory ensured Prussia control of Silesia during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years' War).. The battle was fought at the Silesian town of Leuthen, northwest of Breslau.. By exploiting the training of his troops and his superior knowledge of the terrain, Frederick created a diversion at one end of the battlefield, and moved most of his small army behind a series of low hillocks.. The surprise attack in oblique order on the unsuspecting Austrian flank baffled Prince Charles; the Prince took several hours to realize that the main action was to his left, and not to his right.. Within seven hours, the Prussians destroyed the Austrian force, erasing any advantage the Austrians had gained throughout the campaigning in the preceding summer and autumn.. Within 48 hours, Frederick had laid siege to Breslau, which resulted in that city's surrender on 19\u201320 December.. Leuthen was the last battle at which Prince Charles commanded the Austrian Army, before his sister-in-law, Empress Maria Theresa, appointed him as governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and placed Leopold Joseph von Daun in command of the army.. The battle also established beyond doubt Frederick's military reputation in European circles; it was arguably his greatest tactical victory.",

      "context": "The wars resulted with the collapse and subordination of the Bulgarian Empire, and effectively came to an end with the Ottoman conquest of Tarnovo in July 1393, although other Bulgarian territories, such as the Tsardom of Vidin, held out slightly longer.. As a result of the wars the Ottoman Empire greatly expanded its territory on the Balkan peninsula, stretching from Danube to the Aegean Sea.. The situation in the Balkans on the eve of the Ottoman invasion.. From the 13th century, the two main Balkan powers Byzantium and Bulgaria fell victims to a process of decentralization, as local feudal lords grew stronger and more independent from the emperors in Constantinople and Tarnovo.. This weakened the military and economic power of the central rulers.. The process deteriorated central authority to an even larger extent in the 14th century, when numerous nobles came to be only nominally subordinated to the government.. In Bulgaria the powerful House of Shishman ruled over the Vidin Province in the west, while in the east Balik established a quasi-independent Despotate of Dobruja.. While the two Empires were facing enormous internal difficulties, the Serbs took the favorable opportunity to expand its domain.. During the civil war in Byzantium in 1320s and 1330s, the Serbs conquered most of the Bulgarian and Aromanian populated Macedonia from the Byzantines.. In 1330 Serbian forces defeated Bulgarian ones, led by Emperor Michail Shishman at Velbazhd effectively raising the country to the status of the most powerful state in the region.. In 1346, Serbian king Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an received the title of Emperor with the blessing of the Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Alexander, although after his death in 1355, the large Serbian Empire disintegrated into a few independent states.. In Bulgaria of the same period Ivan Sratsimir inherited Vidin from his father Ivan Alexander in 1356, while despot Dobrotitsa \u2013 nominally his subject \u2013 ruled Dobruja.. Lack of stability was eminent in the southern Balkans as well: in 1341\u20131347 the Byzantine Empire was shaken by a bloody civil war between John V Palaiologos and John VI Kantakouzenos.. Circa mid 14th century the Balkans were politically disunited into a number of small states frequently in competition with each other and there was no single strong entity with a powerful enough army to withstand the Muslim invaders.. In addition to the mainly Orthodox countries such as Bulgaria, Byzantium and Serbia, there were a number of Catholic possessions to the west and south held by Venice, Genoa and the Kingdom of Hungary as well as Kingdom of Bosnia whose Bosnian Church (closely related to the Bogomils) was considered heretic by both Orthodox and Catholics.. Religious dissimilarity was thus also a source for constant political tensions in the region.. Military actions during the reign of Ivan Alexander.. During the civil war in Byzantium both Palaiologos and Kantakouzenos were trying to find external allies and used foreign mercenaries.. The Bulgarian Emperor supported the first opponent whose stronghold was Constantinople.. John Kantakouzenos on the other hand regularly hired Ottoman Turk mercenaries from Asia Minor who soon became a fixture on the battlefields in Thrace.. The Byzantines often lost control over the Ottomans then as the latter regularly plundered villages in the Southern Balkans after the 1320s.. In 1344, Momchil, the independent Bulgarian ruler of the Rhodope and Aegean regions, whose army grew to 2,000 men, took an important role in the Byzantine civil war.. While at first he supported John Kantakouzenos, from the spring of 1344 Momchil reneged, provoked by the aggression of the Ottoman allies.. In June he defeated the Ottoman fleet near the Portogalos bay.. According to sources, at night the Bulgarian ruler sent boats to burn the anchored Ottoman ships and soon after he defeated the army of Kantakouzenos at Mosynopolis.. Probably the first local ruler to become aware of the impending Ottoman threat, Momchil unsuccessfully pleaded with the emperors of Bulgaria and Byzantium for help.. Even though his troops continued the resistance in the Eastern Rhodopes, in May 1345 the Turks led by Umur Beg marched from Asia Minor and devastated Bulgarian territories driving away people and livestock.. Soon after, on 7 July 1345, Ottoman forces under Umur Beg defeated Momchil's army in the battle of Peritor near his capital Xanthi.. Sources attest that the independent ruler perished in the battle without leaving asuccessor, and with little political will or leadership left to counter the Ottoman invasion.. During the Byzantine civil wars Ivan Alexander regained control over several towns in Thrace and the Rhodopes but his frequent interference in the internal affairs of Byzantium hampered any closer relations between the two counties despite the peace established in 1332.. In 1352 Turkish forces invaded Bulgaria anew, raiding Thrace, particularly the vicinities of Aitos, Yambol, and Plovdiv, and capturing rich spoils.. In the same year the Ottomans seized their first fortress on the Balkans, Tsimpe on the Gallipoli peninsula, setting firm foot in Europe.. Until 1354 Ottoman forces again ravaged the lands around Yambol and Plovdiv as well as the lower valleys of the Maritsa and Tundzha rivers.. In 1355 the Ottomans launched a campaign towards Sofia, but were soon engaged by the army of Ivan Alexander's eldest son and heir Michael Asen close to Ihtiman.. The Turks prevailed in the following battle, although both sides suffered heavy casualties.",

Later a third son, al-Qasim, had been designated as third successor.. After Harun died in 809, al-Amin succeeded him in Baghdad.. Encouraged by the Baghdad court, al-Amin began trying to subvert the autonomous status of Khurasan, and al-Qasim was quickly sidelined.. In response, al-Ma'mun sought the support of the provincial \u00e9lites of Khurasan and made moves to assert his own autonomy.. As the rift between the two brothers and their respective camps widened, al-Amin declared his own son Musa as his heir and assembled a large army.. In 811, al-Amin's troops marched against Khurasan, but al-Ma'mun's general Tahir ibn Husayn defeated them in the Battle of Rayy, and then invaded Iraq and besieged Baghdad itself.. The city fell after a year, al-Amin was executed, and al-Ma'mun became Caliph.. Al-Ma'mun chose to remain in Khurasan, however, rather than coming to the capital.. This allowed the power vacuum which the civil war had fostered in the Caliphate's provinces to grow, and several local rulers sprang up in Jazira, Syria and Egypt.. In addition, the pro-Khurasani policies followed by al-Ma'mun's powerful chief minister, al-Fadl ibn Sahl, and al-Ma'mun's espousal of an Alid succession in the person of Ali al-Ridha, alienated the traditional Baghdad \u00e9lites, who saw themselves increasingly marginalized.. Consequently, al-Ma'mun's uncle Ibrahim was proclaimed rival Caliph at Baghdad in 817, forcing al-Ma'mun to intervene personally.. Fadl ibn Sahl was assassinated and al-Ma'mun left Khurasan for Baghdad, which he entered in 819.. The next years saw the consolidation of al-Ma'mun's authority and the re-incorporation of the western provinces against local rebels, a process not completed until the pacification of Egypt in 827..

Many of those in attendance had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation.. The playing field was so damaged by the explosion and by the fans that the White Sox were required to forfeit the second game to the Tigers.. In the late 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was popular in the United States, particularly after being featured in hit films such as \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977).. Disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans.. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July 12 doubleheader.. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP, so admission was discounted to 98 cents for attendees who turned in a disco record; between games, Dahl was to destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.. White Sox officials had hoped for a crowd of 20,000, about 5,000 more than usual.. Instead, at least 50,000\u2014including tens of thousands of Dahl's adherents\u2014packed the stadium, and thousands more continued to sneak in after gates were closed.. Many of the records were not collected by staff and were thrown like flying discs from the stands.. After Dahl blew up the collected records, thousands of fans stormed the field and remained there until dispersed by riot police.. The second game was initially postponed, but forfeited by the White Sox the next day by order of American League president Lee MacPhail.. Disco Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists have described the event as expressive of racism and homophobia..

The pilot, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher, was killed.. It is widely believed he died upon the impact of the missile.. Two F/A-18s from VFA-81 shot down two Iraqi MiG-21s, one with an AIM-7 Sparrow missile and one with an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, in a brief dogfight with their bombs still latched on.. On the opening night of the war two Iraqi MiG-29s attempted to engage a flight of USAF F-15Es.. One of the MiGs crashed while flying at low altitude but the other MiG pressed on.. One of the F-15Es fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder when the MiG locked him up but missed.. Several other F-15Es simultaneously tried to engage the lone MiG-29 but were unable to get the kill.. One F-15E was actually flying past the Iraqi jet and maneuvered in for the kill but the pilot hesitated to take the shot because he was unsure of his wingmen's location and because he did not get a good tone with the Sidewinder missile.. On the first night of the war a USAF EF-111A Raven \"Spark Vark\", flown by pilot Captain James Denton and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) Captain Brent Brandon, was on an electronic warfare mission ahead of a group of jets on a bombing run.. Several IRAF Dassault Mirage F1s came in and engaged the flight.. One of them went after the unarmed EF-111.. Denton executed a tight turn while Brandon launched chaff to avoid missiles fired by the Mirage.. An F-15C on the same flight, piloted by Robert Graeter, went after the Mirage to protect the EF-111.. The Mirage launched a missile, spotted by Brandon, which the Raven avoided by turning and launching chaff.. Denton decided to head for the deck to try to evade his pursuer.. As he went down he pulled up to avoid the ground, the Mirage followed him through, but did not pull up in time and crashed.. An unarmed EF-111 had thus scored an air-air victory against a Dassault Mirage F1, although Graeter was credited with a kill.. The EF-111A crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.. Two IRAF MiG-25s fired missiles at a group of F-15Cs escorting a bombing run in Iraq (which were evaded by the F-15s).. The F-15Cs gave chase, but were forced to give up when the MiGs outran them..

Despite the setbacks, the Partisans remained a credible fighting force, with their organization gaining recognition from the Western Allies at the Tehran Conference and laying the foundations for the post-war Yugoslav state..

The HoR (also known as the Council of Deputies), in control of eastern and southern Libya, has the loyalty of the Libyan National Army of General Khalifa Haftar, and has been supported by airstrikes by Egypt and the UAE.. The GNC, based in western Libya and backed by various different militias (mainly Libya Dawn in the west and Libya Shield in the east) with some support from Qatar, Sudan and Turkey, initially accepted the results of the 2014 election, but rejected them after the Supreme Constitutional Court nullified an amendment regarding the roadmap for Libya's transition and HoR elections.. Due to controversy about constitutional amendments, the HoR refused to take office from GNC in Tripoli, which was controlled by powerful militias from the western coastal city of Misrata.. Instead, the HoR established its parliament in Tobruk, which is controlled by General Haftar's forces.. In December 2015, after long talks in Skhirat, the Libyan Political Agreement was signed.. The LPA was the result of protracted negotiations between rival political camps based in Tripoli, Tobruk, and elsewhere which agreed to unite as the Government of National Accord.. On 30 March 2016, Fayez Sarraj, the head of the GNA, arrived in Tripoli and began working from there despite opposition from GNC.. Although the Government of National Accord is currently the only internationally-recognized government in the country, its authority is still not recognized by the HoR, as specific details acceptable to both sides have not yet been agreed upon, especially regarding the future of Haftar.. In addition to those three factions, there are also smaller rival groups: the Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, led by Ansar al-Sharia, which has had the support of the GNC and was defeated in Benghazi in 2017; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (ISIL's) Libyan provinces; the Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna which expelled ISIL from Derna in July 2015 and was later itself defeated in Derna by the Tobruk government in 2018; as well as many militias and armed groups, whose allegiances often change..

The confrontation was an undeclared war with most of the action occurring in the border area between Indonesia and East Malaysia on the island of Borneo (known as Kalimantan in Indonesia).. The conflict was characterised by restrained and isolated ground combat, set within tactics of low-level brinkmanship.. Combat was usually conducted by company- or platoon-sized operations on either side of the border.. Indonesia's campaign of infiltrations into Borneo sought to exploit the ethnic and religious diversity in Sabah and Sarawak compared to that of Malaya and Singapore, with the intent of unraveling the proposed state of Malaysia.. The jungle terrain of Borneo and lack of roads straddling the Malaysia\u2013Indonesia border forced both Indonesian and Commonwealth forces to conduct long foot patrols..

Krishna Rao, to upgrade the sporadic deployment of forces along the Line of Actual Control with the People's Republic of China.. Since the late 1960s, India had developed an elaborate plan to defend the Himalayan frontier with China.. This involved the provision of screening defences at the Line of Actual Control, or LAC, and the building of strong defence nodes at key points along the frontier.. By the early 1980s, while the forces to man the defences were ready, the nodes were not, and the greatest weakness was in the fact that the servicing road network had not been built.. The decision was taken to resume the defence infrastructure construction.. Since 1962, India had not returned to the site of its major defeat at Namka Chu, an east-west running stream which separates the Thag La and the Hathung La ridge to its south.. India's efforts to occupy Thag La was the casus belli for the October 1962 Chinese military attack on India.. Because there were no other feasible defensive locations north of Tawang, the government had more or less decided that in the event of a new war, they would abandon the town and prepare for battle at the Se La pass to its east.. However, after the 1980 review, it was decided by the military strategists that it was important to defend Tawang in a future conflict.. The army made it clear that the only viable line of defence for Tawang would be along the Hathung La ridge.. In 1983, an Intelligence Bureau team went to the pasturage of Sumdorong Chu which is north-east of the confluence of the Namka Chu and Nyamjiang Chu.. The defence forces stayed through the summer and returned in winter.. This procedure was followed for two years.. In 1986, Indian forces found that the Chinese had preceded them and set up semi-permanent structures there.. In Feb 1986 the army nominated a new chief, General K. Sundarji, who was determined to press the decisions taken by General Krishna Rao.. In addition, Sundarji sought government permission to conduct an exercise named Operation Chequerboard to see how quickly troops based in the Assam plains could take up their positions on the Sino-Indian border..

The seventeenth tropical cyclone, sixteenth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane, Ophelia originated in a tropical wave in the central Atlantic, forming approximately midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles on September 17.. Tracking generally west-northwestward, Ophelia was upgraded to a tropical storm on September 21, and reached an initial peak of 65 mph (100 km/h) on September 22.. As the storm entered a region of higher wind shear it began to weaken, and was subsequently downgraded to a remnant low on September 25.. The following day, however, the remnants of the system began to reorganize as wind shear lessened, and on September 27, the National Hurricane Center once again began advisories on the system.. Moving northward, Ophelia regained tropical storm status early on September 28, and rapidly deepened to attain its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) several days later.. The system weakened as it entered cooler sea surface temperatures and began a gradual transition to an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed by October 3.. Following the development of Ophelia, numerous storm watches and warnings were issued for the northeastern Caribbean Islands.. Residents were urged to prepare for strong winds and substantial flooding.. As the system made its closest approach, Ophelia produced several inches of rainfall, leading to mudslides and several road rescues.",

Following the Soviet advance to the Dnieper in the Battle of the Dnieper during late 1943, German forces managed to hold to the Nikopol bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnieper, the area of manganese ore mines of crucial importance to German war production that Adolf Hitler insisted on holding.. In November and December, the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts conducted multiple unsuccessful attacks against the bridgehead, a salient centered around the supply base and rail junction of Apostolovo, and German troops in the Krivoi Rog area.. Following another failed attack in mid-January, the Nikopol\u2013Krivoy Rog Offensive was launched by the 3rd Ukrainian Front to the north of the salient on 30 January, and elements of the 4th Ukrainian Front to the south of it joined in a day later.. The Soviet troops broke through the 6th Army's lines, capturing Apostolovo on 5 February, splitting the army in half.. Nikopol fell on 8 February, but despite heavy losses the troops in the bridgehead, including the German IV Army Corps, were able to retreat across the Dnieper.. The IV Army Corps launched an unsuccessful counterattack against Apostolovo around this time, resulting in a temporary Soviet pause in order to prepare for the advance against Krivoi Rog, in the northwest portion of the salient.. Two armies of the 3rd Ukrainian Front began the advance towards that city on 17 February, and captured it on 22 February.. Other armies from the front then resumed the advance and captured several bridgeheads over the Inhulets river, which became the next German defensive line.. Fighting in the area died down, but the Soviet gains paved the way for subsequent advances during the second phase of the Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive..

Attacks against Mozambican and Congolese immigrants.. Between 1984 and the end of hostilities in that country, an estimated 50,000 to 350,000 Mozambicans fled to South Africa.. While never granted refugee status they were technically allowed to settle in the bantustans or black homelands created during the apartheid system.. The reality was more varied, with the homeland of Lebowa banning Mozambican settlers outright while Gazankulu welcomed the refugees with support in the form of land and equipment.. Those in Gazankulu, however, found themselves confined to the homeland and liable for deportation should they officially enter South Africa, and evidence exists that their hosts denied them access to economic resources.. Unrest and civil war likewise saw large numbers of Congolese people emigrate to South Africa, many illegally, in 1993 and 1997.. Subsequent studies found indications of xenophobic attitudes towards these refugees, typified by them being denied access to the primary healthcare to which they were technically entitled..

The study was based on a citizen survey across member states of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and found South Africans expressing the harshest anti-immigrant sentiment, with 21% of South Africans in favour of a complete ban on foreign entry and 64% in favour of strict limitations on the numbers permitted.",

As a result, the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter.. In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at Incheon, and cut off many KPA troops in South Korea.. Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north.. UN forces invaded North Korea in October 1950 and moved rapidly towards the Yalu River\u2014the border with China\u2014but on 19 October 1950, Chinese forces of the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) crossed the Yalu and entered the war.. The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces back below the 38th Parallel by late December.. In these and subsequent battles, Seoul changed hands four times, and the last two years of fighting became a war of attrition, with the front line close to the 38th Parallel.. The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate.. North Korea was subject to a massive U.S. bombing campaign.. Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies.. The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed.. The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners.. However, no peace treaty was ever signed, and the two Koreas are technically still at war, engaged in a frozen conflict.. In April 2018, the leaders of North and South Korea met at the DMZ and agreed to work towards a treaty to formally end the Korean War..

The British were in turn outraged by the \"Little Belt\" affair in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died.. Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment.. Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America (Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war.. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British.. On June 18, 1812, President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.. With most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon, Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier.. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity, especially in New England, where it was referred to as \"Mr. Madison's War\".. American defeats at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights thwarted attempts to seize Upper Canada, improving British morale.. American attempts also failed to invade Lower Canada and capture Montreal.. In 1813, the Americans won the Battle of Lake Erie, gaining control of the lake, and they defeated Tecumseh's Confederacy at the Battle of the Thames, securing a primary war goal.. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the Battle of Lundy's Lane during the summer of 1814.. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will.. In 1814, one of these raids burned the capital, but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to invade New York and Maryland, ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states.. In early 1815, the Americans decisively defeated the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana..

The KLA, formed in the early 1990s to fight against Serbian persecution of Kosovo Albanians, initiated its first campaign in 1995 when it launched attacks against Serbian law enforcement in Kosovo.. In June 1996 the group claimed responsibility for acts of sabotage targeting Kosovo police stations.. In 1997, the organisation acquired a large amount of arms through weapons smuggling from Albania, following a rebellion in which weapons were looted from the country's police and army posts.. In early 1998, KLA attacks targeting Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo resulted in an increased presence of Serb paramilitaries and regular forces who subsequently began pursuing a campaign of retribution targeting KLA sympathisers and political opponents; this campaign killed 1,500 to 2,000 civilians and KLA combatants.. After attempts at a diplomatic solution failed, NATO intervened, justifying the campaign in Kosovo as a \"humanitarian war\".. This precipitated a mass expulsion of Kosovar Albanians as the Yugoslav forces continued to fight during the aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia (March\u2013June 1999).. By 2000, investigations had recovered the remains of almost three thousand victims of all ethnicities, and in 2001 a United Nations administered Supreme Court, based in Kosovo, found that there had been \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\", but that Yugoslav troops had tried to remove rather than eradicate the Albanian population.. The war ended with the Kumanovo Treaty, with Yugoslav and Serb forces agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo to make way for an international presence.. The Kosovo Liberation Army disbanded soon after this, with some of its members going on to fight for the U\u00c7PMB in the Pre\u0161evo Valley and others joining the National Liberation Army (NLA) and Albanian National Army (ANA) during the armed ethnic conflict in Macedonia, while others went on to form the Kosovo Police.. After the war, a list was compiled which documented that over 13,500 people were killed or went missing during the two year conflict.",

Three other suspects were released as unconnected with the crime, though they heard about it from the alleged murderers.. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas blamed the murder on the Israeli government and demanded Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu condemn it \"as we condemned the kidnapping of the three Israelis\"..

Historian Tristram Hunt (a former Labour MP) has described the confrontation as \"almost medieval in its choreography ... at various stages a siege, a battle, a chase, a rout and, finally, a brutal example of legalised state violence\"..

The trials collapsed when the evidence given by the police was deemed \"unreliable\"..

Following the 2016 inquest verdict into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, previously censored documents suggesting links between the actions of senior South Yorkshire Police officers at both incidents were published..

Turner's ideas since 1893 have inspired generations of historians (and critics) to explore multiple individual American frontiers, but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of Native American lands west of the Mississippi River, in what is now the Midwest, Texas, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, the Southwest, the West Coast, and Hawaii.. In 19th- and early 20th-century media, enormous popular attention was focused on the Western United States in the second half of the 19th century, from the 1860s to the 1890s, a period sometimes called the \"Old West\" or the \"Wild West\".. Such media typically exaggerated the romance, anarchy, and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect.. This eventually inspired the Western genre of film, which spilled over into television shows, novels, and comic books, as well as children's toys, games and costumes.. As defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states.\". They explain, \"It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.\". Through treaties with foreign nations and native tribes, political compromise, military conquest, establishment of law and order, the building of farms, ranches, and towns, the marking of trails and digging of mines, and the pulling in of great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast, fulfilling the dreams of manifest destiny.",

Nine nuclear explosions were initiated, culminating in the United Kingdom becoming the third recognised possessor of thermonuclear weapons, and the restoration of the nuclear Special Relationship with the United States with the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement.. During the Second World War, Britain had a nuclear weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys, which was merged with the American Manhattan Project in August 1943.. Many of Britain's top scientists participated in the British contribution to the Manhattan Project.. After the war, fearing that Britain would lose its great power status, the British government resumed the atomic bomb development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research.. The successful test of an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement, but Britain was still several years behind the United States in nuclear weapons technology.. In July 1954, the Cabinet decided to develop the hydrogen bomb.. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston produced three designs: Orange Herald, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear weapon.. The first test series consisted of three tests in May and June 1957.. In the first, Grapple 1, a version of Green Granite known as Short Granite was dropped from a Vickers Valiant bomber flown by Wing Commander Kenneth Hubbard.. The bomb's yield was estimated at , far below its designed capability.. Despite its failure, the test was hailed as a successful thermonuclear explosion, and the government did not confirm or deny reports that the UK had become a third thermonuclear power.. The second test was Grapple 2, of Orange Herald.. Its yield made it technically a megaton weapon.. It was the largest ever achieved by a single stage device.. Grapple 3 tested Purple Granite, a Short Granite with some fixes.",

It was the first of Justinian I's wars of reconquest of the lost Western Roman Empire.. The Vandals had occupied Roman North Africa in the early 5th century, and established an independent kingdom there.. Under their first king, Geiseric, the formidable Vandal navy carried out pirate attacks across the Mediterranean, sacked Rome and defeated a massive Roman invasion in 468.. After Geiseric's death, relations with the surviving Eastern Roman Empire normalized, although tensions flared up occasionally due to the Vandals' militant adherence to Arianism and their persecution of the Chalcedonian native population.. In 530, a palace coup in Carthage overthrew the pro-Roman Hilderic and replaced him with his cousin Gelimer.. The Eastern Roman emperor Justinian took this as a pretext to interfere in Vandal affairs, and after he secured his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he began preparing an expedition under general Belisarius, whose secretary Procopius wrote the main historical narrative of the war.. Justinian took advantage of, or even instigated, rebellions in the remote Vandal provinces of Sardinia and Tripolitania.. These not only distracted Gelimer from the Emperor's preparations, but also weakened Vandal defences through the dispatch of the bulk of the Vandal navy and a large portion of their army under Gelimer's brother Tzazon to Sardinia.. The Roman expeditionary force set sail from Constantinople in late June 533, and after a sea voyage along the coasts of Greece and southern Italy, landed on the African coast at Caputvada in early September, to Gelimer's complete surprise.. The Vandal king gathered his forces and met the Roman army at the Battle of Ad Decimum, near Carthage, on 13 September.. Gelimer's elaborate plan to encircle and destroy the Roman army came close to success, but Belisarius was able to drive the Vandal army to flight and occupy Carthage.. Gelimer withdrew to Bulla Regia, where he gathered his remaining strength, including the army of Tzazon, which returned from Sardinia..

Other city-states also joined, including Cempoala and and polities bordering Lake Texcoco, the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico.. Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual (Nahuatl, a Maya dialect, and Spanish) indigenous slave woman, known to the Spanish conquistadors as Do\u00f1a Marina, and generally as La Malinche.. After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II to his visit, Cort\u00e9s arrived in Tenochtitlan on 8 November 1519, where he took up residence with fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies.. When news reached Cort\u00e9s of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the Totonacs in Veracruz, Cortes claims that he took Motecuhzoma captive.. Capturing the cacique or indigenous ruler was standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Motecuhzoma had considerable precedent but modern scholars are skeptical that Cortes and his countrymen took Motecuhzoma captive at this time.. They had great incentive to claim they did, owing to the laws of Spain at this time, but critical analysis of their personal writings suggest Motecuhzoma was not taken captive until a much later date..

Alvarado allowed a significant Aztec feast to be celebrated in Tenochtitlan and on the pattern of the earlier massacre in Cholula, closed off the square and massacred the celebrating Aztec noblemen.. The official biography of Cort\u00e9s by Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara contains a description of the massacre.. The Alvarado massacre at the Main Temple of Tenochtitlan precipitated rebellion by the population of the city.. Moctezuma was killed, although the sources do not agree on who murdered him..

These demonstrations, which followed the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation (February to March 2014), and which were part of a wider group of concurrent pro-Russian protests across southern and eastern Ukraine, escalated into an armed conflict between the separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively), and the Ukrainian government.. In the Donetsk People's Republic, from May 2014 until a change of the top leadership in August 2014, some of the top leaders were Russian citizens..

Whether the occupants of Bud Dajo were hostile to U.S. forces is disputed, as inhabitants of Jolo Island had previously used the crater as a place of refuge during Spanish assaults.. Major Hugh Scott, the District Governor of Sulu Province, where the incident occurred, recounted that those who fled to the crater \"declared they had no intention of fighting, - ran up there only in fright, [and] had some crops planted and desired to cultivate them.\". The description of the engagement as a \"battle\" is disputed because of both the overwhelming firepower of the attackers and the lopsided casualties.. The author Vic Hurley wrote, \"By no stretch of the imagination could Bud Dajo be termed a 'battle'\".. Mark Twain commented, \"In what way was it a battle?. It has no resemblance to a battle ... We cleaned up our four days' work and made it complete by butchering these helpless people.\". A higher percentage of Moros were killed than in other incidents now considered massacres.. For example, the highest estimate of Native Americans killed at the Wounded Knee Massacre is 300 out of 350 (a death rate of 85 percent), whereas in Bud Dajo there were only six Moro survivors out of a group estimated at 1,000 (a death rate of over 99 percent).. As at Wounded Knee, the Moro group included women and children.. Moro men in the crater who had arms possessed melee weapons..

Phillips and Matasareanu are believed to have robbed at least two other banks using similar methods by taking control of the entire bank and firing illegally modified automatic weapons chambered for intermediate cartridges for control and entry past 'bullet-proof' security doors, and were suspects in two armored car robberies.. Standard issue sidearms carried by most local patrol officers at the time were 9 mm pistols or .38 Special revolvers; some patrol cars were also equipped with a 12-gauge shotgun.. Phillips and Matasareanu carried illegally modified fully automatic Norinco Type 56 S-1s (an AK-47 variant), a Bushmaster XM15 Dissipator with high-capacity drum magazine, and a Heckler & Koch HK-91 rifle, as well as a Beretta 92FS pistol.. The robbers wore mostly homemade, heavy plated body armor which successfully protected them from handgun rounds and shotgun pellets fired by the responding officers.. A police SWAT team eventually arrived bearing sufficient firepower, and they commandeered an armored truck to evacuate the wounded.. Several officers also appropriated AR-15 and other semi-automatic rifles from a nearby firearms dealer.. The incident sparked debate on the need for patrol officers to upgrade their firepower in preparation for similar situations in the future.",

In 1655, Charles X Gustav of Sweden invaded and occupied western Poland\u2013Lithuania, the eastern half of which was already occupied by Russia.. The rapid Swedish advance became known in Poland as the Swedish Deluge.. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a Swedish fief, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian regular armies surrendered and the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa fled to the Habsburgs.. Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia initially supported the estates in Royal Prussia, but allied with Sweden in return for receiving the Duchy of Prussia as a Swedish fief.. Exploiting the hurt religious feelings of the Roman Catholic population under Protestant occupation and organizing Polish\u2013Lithuanian military leaders in the Tyszowce Confederation, John II Casimir Vasa managed to regain ground in 1656.. Russia took advantage of the Swedish setback, declared war on Sweden and pushed into Lithuania and Swedish Livonia.. Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William full sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia in return for military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied himself with the Transylvanian George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi who invaded Poland\u2013Lithuania from the southeast.. John II Vasa found an ally in Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland\u2013Lithuania from the southwest.. This triggered Frederick III of Denmark's invasion of the Swedish mainland in the spring of 1657, in an attempt to settle old scores from the Torstenson War while Sweden was busy elsewhere.. Brandenburg left the alliance with Sweden when granted full sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia by the Polish king in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg.. Frederick III's war on Sweden gave Charles X Gustav a reason to abandon the Polish\u2013Lithuanian deadlock and fight Denmark instead.. After marching his army to the west and making a dangerous crossing of the frozen straits in the winter of 1657/58, he surprised the unprepared Frederick III on the Danish isles and forced him into surrender.. In the Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark had to abandon all Danish provinces in what is now Southern Sweden.. The anti-Swedish allies meanwhile neutralized the Transylvanian army and Polish forces ravaged Swedish Pomerania.. In 1658 Charles X Gustav decided that instead of returning to the remaining Swedish strongholds in Poland\u2013Lithuania, he would rather attack Denmark again.. This time, Denmark withstood the attack and the anti-Swedish allies pursued Charles X Gustav to Jutland and Swedish Pomerania.. Throughout 1659, Sweden was defending her strongholds in Denmark and on the southern Baltic shore, while little was gained by the allies and a peace was negotiated.",

Over the years, the case has been marked by accusations of cover-ups.. All suspects in the \"local connection\" (among them, many members of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police) were found to be not guilty in September 2004.. In August 2005, federal judge Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano, in charge of the case, was impeached and removed from his post on a charge of \"serious\" irregularities due to mishandling of the investigation.. In 2005, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who would later become Pope Francis, was the first public personality to sign a petition for justice in the AMIA bombing case.. He was one of the signatories on a document called \"85 victims, 85 signatures\" as part of the bombing's 11th anniversary.. On 25 October 2006, Argentine prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Mart\u00ednez Burgos formally accused the government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the Hezbollah militia of carrying it out.. According to the prosecution's claims in 2006, Argentina had been targeted by Iran after Buenos Aires' decision to suspend a nuclear technology transfer contract to Tehran.. This has been disputed because the contract was never terminated and Iran and Argentina were negotiating on restoration of full cooperation on all agreements from early 1992 until 1994, when the bombing occurred.. In 2015 Alberto Nisman filed a 300-page document accusing Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of covering up Iran's role in the incident.. Nisman was murdered hours before he was due to testify against the former president, which the Federal Court of Buenos Aires ruled was a \u201cdirect consequence\u201d of Nisman's accusations against Kirchner.. In 2017, Judge Claudio Bonadio accused Kirchner of treason and called on the country's senate to permit her arrest and trial for allegedly covering up Iranian involvement in the 1994 bomb attack.. Kirchner is currently referred for public trial over alleged cover-up of Iranian involvement in the bombing.. The thirteenth anniversary of the bombing was commemorated on 18 July 2007.. In addition to nationwide exhibitions and ceremonies, radio and television stations and police cars all across Argentina sounded sirens at 9:53 am, the time of the bombing.",

The event was held in three cities over the Easter long weekend: Brisbane on 13 and 14 April, Sydney on 15 April and Melbourne on 16 April.. The festival had an excellent line up but suffered when both headlining acts, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stone Temple Pilots, withdrew from the event.. Lou Reed was added to the bill in their place but without the show's main drawcards, ticket sales were slow.. Unlike the Big Day Out, which featured various local acts at each city, Alternative Nation's line-up was the same at all three events, except in Brisbane where four more Australian bands, Budd, Catfish, Dreamkillers and Chalk were included.. Somewhat cynically, however, all of the Australian bands that performed in Melbourne and Sydney, except Def FX, were relegated to smaller stages away from the main performance area.. In Melbourne, future Australian music superstars Powderfinger played on the back of a flatbed truck for a crowd of approximately 40 people.. The headlining acts were Faith No More, Lou Reed, Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Violent Femmes, Ice-T, L7, Ween, Primus, Bodycount, Pop Will Eat Itself, The Flaming Lips, The Tea Party, The Prodigy, Therapy?, Live and Pennywise.. Local acts included Regurgitator, Horsehead, Powderfinger, Supergroove, Def FX and Spiderbait.. The Sydney show was marked by constant rain throughout the day that transformed the venue, Eastern Creek Raceway, into a mudbowl and several bands were pelted with mud by the audience.. Live's Ed Kowalczyk retaliated to this behaviour by throwing a guitar into the crowd at the end of his band's set.. In Melbourne the rain cleared in the afternoon and a very good set was performed by Tool in front of a fairly large crowd, the music enhanced by a very powerful sound system..

Playing 93 shows in 1972, the most until 1994, Pink Floyd debuted the live performance before its release not of a song but a whole album.. The original title was \"Eclipse\", then \"Dark Side of the Moon \u2013 A Piece for Assorted Lunatics\", the name under which it made its press debut in February 1972 at London's Rainbow Theatre.. The title changed for the first part of the US tour to \"Eclipse (A Piece for Assorted Lunatics)\" during April and May before reverting to \"Dark Side of the Moon \u2013 A Piece for Assorted Lunatics\" in September for the second part of the US tour and finally released in 1973 under the title of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"..

The line \"Lying supine in the sunshine\" was sung instead of \"Tired of lying in the sunshine\", even in shows after the album's release (as evidenced on the live companion they released with the album in 2011).. \"The Great Gig in the Sky\", whose working title was \"Religion\" or \"The Mortality Sequence\", consisted at the debut in January of synthesized organ and various tapes of \"preachers\" either preaching or reading from such passages as from Chapter 5, Verse 13 of Ephesians, a book of the Bible, or reciting The Lord's Prayer.. Starting in September, the music of the song as per the album was performed, without vocals..

The location of \"Surface Ground Zero\" is .. The depth of the test cavity was approximately below the ground surface.. It was part of the Operation Mandrel weapons test series under the name Mandrel Rulison, as well as the Operation Plowshare project which explored peaceful engineering uses of nuclear explosions.. The peaceful aim of Project Rulison was to determine if natural gas could be easily liberated from underground regions.. This site remains under active monitoring by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management.. The test succeeded in liberating large quantities of natural gas; however the resulting radioactivity left the gas contaminated and unsuitable for applications such as cooking and heating homes.. Although projected public radiation exposures from commercial use of stimulated gas had been reduced to less than 1% of background, it became clear in the early 1970s that public acceptance within the U.S. of any product containing radioactivity, no matter how minimal, was difficult if not impossible.. The Department of Energy began a cleanup of the site in the 1970s which was completed in 1998.. A buffer zone put in place by the state of Colorado still exists around the site.. A January 2005 report by the DOE stated that radioactivity levels were normal at the surface and in groundwater, though a later report due in 2007 was expected to more fully explore if there was subsurface contamination and whether or not radioactivity was still spreading outward from the blast site itself.. As of June 2005, the Houston, Texas-based company Presco was seeking to drill for natural gas within the buffer zone, putting in as many as four wells.. The company had initially received approval to drill one well, but the county dropped its support when more extensive plans were revealed.",

Israeli forces attacked police stations, military targets including weapons caches and suspected rocket firing teams, as well as political and administrative institutions in the opening assault, striking in the densely populated cities of Gaza, Khan Yunis and Rafah..

After independence, this neutrality, though maintained, started to diverge as Sihanouk allied himself principally with politicians on the right of the political spectrum.. He did attempt to ally himself with certain members of the political left, such as Khieu Samphan.. However, according to Etcheson, his relations with his domestic left were perfunctory and at most tactical.. \u201cThe Prince encouraged his security forces to persecute the mass organizations of the Left, especially the main Leftist one, the Pracheachon, and its covert sister organizations in the countryside and the cities.\u201d Progressively, there appeared to be increasingly visible cracks within the political sphere as respective sides, strengthened and consolidated.. As the Left gradually co-ordinated its activities, holding demonstrations in the towns, attacking the government and conducting propaganda efforts in the countryside, the predominantly right-winged government upped its military and economic regulations.. While Sihanouk was away in France, allowing Lon Nol to have considerable autonomy in effecting his economic policies.. Often identified as the main driver of the rebellion, the rammassage du paddy was an efficient system imposed by Lon Nol in early 1967 whereby the government channels (mainly the military) took charge of buying and collecting the rice crops from the peasants.. This was in response to the rise of a large rice export black market that greatly affected Cambodia's economy as it was heavily dependent on its taxation of rice exports.. Here, farmers illegally sold much of Cambodia's rice to Vietnamese Communists across the borders as they paid more as compared the Cambodian government.. Lon Nol was seriously concerned about the sale of large proportions of the rice crop to the National Liberation Front(N.L.F) for Southern Vietnam or on the Saigon black market where clandestine sales were apparently handled by local Chinese middlemen who had found friends and worked in conjunction with cells of former Viet Minh sympathizers acting on behalf of the N.L.F.. This system provoked an uproar by the rural population in Battambang Province where it was first introduced as many households not only saw their earnings being severely reduced due to the low prices offered for the crops but were also forcibly made to surrender their produce at gunpoint.. Furthermore, the strong intervention and presence of the army in Battambang involved the forming of co-operatives, forcing villagers to regroup while bearing the obligation of being a co-operative member in paying subscriptions to finance loans that fell into the hands of corrupted officials..

They were previously commonly referred to as the Land Wars or the M\u0101ori Wars while M\u0101ori language names for the conflicts included Ng\u0101 pakanga o Aotearoa (\"the great New Zealand wars\") and Te riri P\u0101keh\u0101 (\"the white man's anger\").. Historian James Belich popularised the name \"New Zealand Wars\" in the 1980s, although the term was first used by historian James Cowan in the 1920s.. Though the wars were initially localised conflicts triggered by tensions over disputed land purchases, they escalated dramatically from 1860 as the government became convinced it was facing united M\u0101ori resistance to further land sales and a refusal to acknowledge Crown sovereignty.. The colonial government summoned thousands of British troops to mount major campaigns to overpower the K\u012bngitanga (M\u0101ori King) movement and also acquire farming and residential land for British settlers.. Later campaigns were aimed at quashing the so-called Hauhau movement, an extremist part of the Pai M\u0101rire religion, which was strongly opposed to the alienation of M\u0101ori land and eager to strengthen M\u0101ori identity.. At the peak of hostilities in the 1860s, 18,000 British troops, supported by artillery, cavalry and local militia, battled about 4,000 M\u0101ori warriors in what became a gross imbalance of manpower and weaponry.",

The Cold War had a powerful disintegrative effect on Lebanon, which was closely linked to the polarization that preceded the 1958 political crisis, since Maronites sided with the West while leftist and pan-Arab groups sided with Soviet-aligned Arab countries.. Fighting between Maronite and Palestinian forces (mainly from the Palestine Liberation Organization) began in 1975, then Leftist, pan-Arabist and Muslim Lebanese groups formed an alliance with the Palestinians..

The Assyrian genocide took place in the same context as the Armenian and Greek genocides.. Since the Assyrian genocide took place within the context of the much more widespread Armenian genocide, scholarship treating it as a separate event is scarce, with the exceptions of the works of Joseph Yacoub, Gabriele Yonan, David Gaunt and Hannibal Travis, who have classified the genocide as a systematic campaign by the Young Turk government.. Other scholars, such as Hilmar Kaiser, Donald Bloxham and Taner Ak\u00e7am have differing opinions with regards to the extent of governmental involvement and systematic nature in the killings, asserting a less systematic policy and different treatment in comparison to the Armenians.. Unlike the Armenians, there were no orders to deport Assyrians.. The attacks against them were not of a standardized nature and incorporated various methods; in some cities, all Assyrian men were slain and the women were forced to flee.. These massacres were often carried out upon the initiatives of local politicians and Kurdish tribes.. Exposure, disease and starvation during the flight of Assyrians increased the death toll, and women were subjected to widespread sexual abuse in some areas.. Estimates on the overall death toll have varied.. Providing detailed statistics of the various estimates of the Churches' population after the genocide, David Gaunt accepts the figure of 275,000 deaths as reported by the Assyrian delegation at the Treaty of Lausanne and ventures that the death toll would be around 300,000 because of uncounted Assyrian-inhabited areas.. Rudolph Rummel gives the number of Christian deaths in Assyrian-populated regions of Turkey as 102,000 and adds to this the killing of around 47,000 Assyrians in Persia.. In 2007, the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) reached a consensus that the \"Ottoman campaign against Christian minorities of the Empire between 1914 and 1923 constituted a genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, and Pontian and Anatolian Greeks.\".

It began on 26 October 1185, the feast day of St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki, and ended with the restoration of Bulgaria with the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire, ruled by the Asen dynasty.. Isaac II Angelus, in order to raise money for his wedding with the daughter of King B\u00e9la III of Hungary, levied a new tax which fell heavily on the population of the Haemus Mountains.. They sent two leaders (Peter and Asen) to negotiate with the emperor at Kypsella (now \u0130psala) in Thrace.. They asked to be added to the roll of the Byzantine army and to be granted land near Haemus to provide the monetary income needed to pay the tax.. This was refused, and Peter and Asen were treated roughly.. Their response was to threaten revolt.. After their return, many of the protesters were unwilling to join the rebellion.. The brothers Peter and Asen built the Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki in Tarnovo, dedicated to Saint Demetrius, who was traditionally considered a patron of the Byzantine city of Thessaloniki, and claimed that the Saint had ceased to favour the Byzantines: \"God had decided to free the Bulgarians and the Vlach people and to lift the yoke that they had borne for so long\".. This persuaded their followers to attack Byzantine cities, seizing prisoners and cattle.. Preslav, capital of the First Bulgarian Empire, was raided, and it was after this symbolic incident that Peter assumed the insignia of Tsar (or Emperor).. In the spring of 1186, Isaac started a counter-offensive.. It was successful at first.. During the solar eclipse of 21 April 1186, the Byzantines successfully attacked the rebels, many of whom fled north of the Danube, making contact with the Cumans.. In a symbolic gesture, Isaac II entered Peter's house and took the icon of Saint Demetrius, thus regaining the saint's favour.. Still under threat of ambush from the hills, Isaac returned hastily to Constantinople to celebrate his victory.. Thus, when the armies of Bulgarians and the Vlachs returned, reinforced with their Cuman allies, they found the region undefended and regained not only their old territory but the whole of Moesia, a considerable step towards the establishment of a new Bulgarian state.. The Emperor now entrusted the war to his uncle, John the sebastocrator, who gained several victories against the rebels but then himself rebelled.. He was replaced with the emperor's brother-in-law, John Kantakouzenos, a good strategist but unfamiliar with the guerrilla tactics used by the mountaineers.. His army was ambushed, suffering heavy losses, after unwisely pursuing the enemy into the mountains.. The third general in charge of fighting the rebels was Alexius Branas, who, in turn, rebelled and turned on Constantinople.. Isaac defeated him with the help of a second brother-in-law, Conrad of Montferrat, but this civil strife had diverted attention from the rebels and Isaac was able to send out a new army only in September 1187.. The Byzantines obtained a few minor victories before winter, but the rebels, helped by the Cumans and employing their mountain tactics, still held the advantage.. In the spring of 1187, Isaac attacked the fortress of Lovech, but failed to capture it after a three-month siege.",

The first Persian invasion was a response to Athenian involvement in the Ionian Revolt, when Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule.. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis, but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses.. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria.. According to Herodotus, Darius had his bow brought to him and then shot an arrow \"upwards towards heaven\", saying as he did so: \"Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!\".. Herodotus further writes that Darius charged one of his servants to say \"Master, remember the Athenians\" three times before dinner each day.. At the time of the battle, Sparta and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece.. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece.. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean, to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria.. Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria.. The Persian force then sailed for Attica, landing in the bay near the town of Marathon.. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon.. The Athenians also sent a message asking for support to the Spartans.. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a reason for not coming to aid of the Athenians.. The Athenians and their allies chose a location for the battle, with marshes and mountainous terrain, that prevented the Persian cavalry from joining the Persian infantry.. Miltiades, the Athenian general, ordered a general attack against the Persian forces, composed primarily of missile troops.. He reinforced his flanks, luring the Persians' best fighters into his centre.. The inward wheeling flanks enveloped the Persians, routing them..

In the morning hours of the next day, the military regime blew up the historic Rangoon University Students' Union (RUSU) building, which had been the symbol of the anti-colonial nationalism struggle since the 1920s.. The reaction of the military regime disclosed for the first time its new tough stance against all regime opponents as part of implementing the new state ideology, the Burmese Way to Socialism, which included bringing \"almost all of Burma's political, social, and economic life under strict military control\".. It also demonstrated that the effective suppression of student activism and the de-politicisation of the universities ranked high among the strategic goals of the new government.. Students had been in the vanguard of the Burmese anti-colonial nationalist struggle ever since the first student protests in Burma began in 1920.. Although the regime had been successful in ending the student protests, the violent reaction nonetheless undermined its support among the broader population and created a symbolic focal point for later student protests in the following decades.. In the aftermath of the violent crackdown on the student protests, the Government of Ne Win immediately closed all universities for four months and sent all students home.. Broad institutional reforms introduced by the 1964 University Education Act, then, brought Burma's universities under strict government control and profoundly hampered cohesive open student activism in subsequent decades.. In this respect, the result of the 1962 Rangoon University protests ushered a new era of underground student activism in which open mass student involvement in national politics erupted only sporadically, most prominently during the student protests of the mid-1970s and during the 8888 Uprising in 1988..

In many countries, the governments have also recognized the importance of social media for organizing and have shut down certain sites or blocked Internet service entirely, especially in the times preceding a major rally.. Governments have also scrutinized or suppressed discussion in those forums through accusing content creators of unrelated crimes or shutting down communication on specific sites or groups, such as through Facebook (Solomon, 2011; Seyid, 2011).. The effects of the Tunisian Revolution spread strongly to five other countries: Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain, where either the regime was toppled or major uprisings and social violence occurred, including riots, civil wars or insurgencies.. Sustained street demonstrations took place in Morocco, Iraq, Algeria, Iranian Khuzestan, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan.. Minor protests occurred in Djibouti, Mauritania, the Palestinian National Authority, Saudi Arabia, and the Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara.. A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world is \"ash-sha\u02bbb yur\u012bd isq\u0101\u1e6d an-ni\u1e93\u0101m\" (\"the people want to bring down the regime\").. The wave of initial revolutions and protests faded by mid-2012, as many Arab Spring demonstrations were met with violent responses from authorities, as well as from pro-government militias, counter-demonstrators and militaries.. These attacks were answered with violence from protestors in some cases..

Rome's war against the Gallic tribes lasted from 58 BC to 50 BC and culminated in the decisive Battle of Alesia in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the Roman Republic over the whole of Gaul (mainly present-day France and Belgium).. While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the internal division between the Gallic tribes helped ease victory for Caesar, and Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late.. The wars paved the way for Julius Caesar to become the sole ruler of the Roman Republic.. Although Caesar portrayed this invasion as being a preemptive and defensive action, most historians agree that the wars were fought primarily to boost Caesar's political career and to pay off his massive debts.. Still, Gaul was of significant military importance to the Romans, as they had been attacked several times by native tribes both indigenous to Gaul and farther to the north.. Conquering Gaul allowed Rome to secure the natural border of the river Rhine..

(Additionally, Chinese Malaysians constituted a large portion of the population of Malaya/Malaysia at the time and continue to this day.). However, Tunku changed his mind to call for the merger with Singapore, when the Pro-communist Singaporean leader Ong Eng Guan had won a seat for the PAP in one of the by-elections..

The conflict escalated after the withdrawal of Spain from the Spanish Sahara in accordance with the Madrid Accords.. Beginning in 1975, the Polisario Front, backed and supported by Algeria, waged a 16-year-long war for independence against Mauritania and Morocco.. In February 1976, the Polisario Front declared the establishment of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, which was not admitted into the United Nations, but won limited recognition by a number of other states.. Following the annexation of Western Sahara by Morocco and Mauritania in 1976, and the Polisario Front's declaration of independence, the UN addressed the conflict via a resolution reaffirming the right to self-determination of the Sahrawi people.. In 1977, France intervened as the conflict reached its peak intensity.. In 1979, Mauritania withdrew from the conflict and territories, leading to a stalemate through most of the 1980s.. After several more engagements between 1989 and 1991, a cease-fire agreement was reached between the Polisario Front and the Moroccan government.. At the time, most of the Western Sahara territory remained under Moroccan control, while the Polisario controlled some 20% of the territory in its capacity as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, with additional pockets of control in the Sahrawi refugee camps along the Algerian border.. At present, these borders are largely unchanged.. Despite multiple peace initiatives through the 1990s and early 2000s, the conflict reemerged as the \"Independence Intifada\" in 2005; a series of disturbances, demonstrations and riots, which broke out in May 2005 in the Moroccan-held portions of Western Sahara, and lasted until November of that same year.. In late 2010, the protests re-erupted in the Gdeim Izik refugee camp in Western Sahara.. While the protests were initially peaceful, they were later marked by clashes between civilians and security forces, resulting in dozens of casualties on both sides..

Reinforced by the XIV Reserve Corps the Germans on the north side of the Somme attacked again and took Mametz on 29 September.. After a mutually costly battle for Fricourt, where the French were eventually forced out, the front line stabilised and both sides began to dig improvised defences.. In mid-December the French conducted a local attack in the Mametz area but were repulsed with many casualties.. Mine warfare began soon after a front line was established but the most extensive mining took place further north at La Boisselle and during 1915, the area around Mametz became a comparative backwater.. The Germans began systematic fortification of the area, according to a directive from Erich von Falkenhayn the German army Chief of Staff, to fortify the Western Front so that a small number of infantry could defend the front indefinitely and later in the year began work on second and third defensive positions but in the Somme area, the defences north of the Bapaume\u2013Albert were improved first and by July 1916 the first position defences around Mametz were extensive but the second position was a shallow trench and the third position had only been marked out.. In June 1916 the British preliminary bombardment cut much of the barbed wire protecting the Mametz defences and destroyed many of the trenches in the first position occupied by Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 of the 28th Reserve Division.. When the 7th Division advanced behind a creeping barrage, much of the German front line was quickly overrun and many prisoners taken; delays further forward caused the infantry to lag behind the barrage and suffer far more casualties.. Mametz was occupied during the morning by the 20th Brigade but a German counter-attack forced most of the British troops out, until a second attack during the afternoon, when the advance of the 18th (Eastern) Division on the right flank, had cut the Germans in the village off from Montauban to the east..

So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during 1797, but had been called off following the Treaty of Campo Formio in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore.. To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at Macau in the winter of 1797\u201398, the British commander in the East Indies, Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier, sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS \"Sybille\" and HMS \"Fox\" and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke.. After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself.. He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila, which would make a valuable prize.. Sailing in \"Sybille\" and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in \"Fox\", Cooke reached the Spanish capital on 13 January 1798.. Anchored in Manila Bay, Cooke pretended that his ships were French vessels and successfully lured successive boatloads of Spanish officials aboard, taking them prisoner in turn.. Once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in Manila, that the treasure ship had been unloaded at Cavite and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations, he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the Pasig River.. Capturing the gunboats in a bloodless attack, Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards, unsuccessfully assaulting Zamboanga before returning to Macau.",

The Dutch Republic had been a British ally during the French Revolutionary Wars, but was overrun by the French Republic in the winter of 1794 and reformed into the client state of the Batavian Republic..

To achieve this, British warships maintained a constant vigil off the French coastline, attacking ships that attempted to enter or leave French ports.. Despite the threat that their ships faced, communication and the transfer of supplies between France and her colonies was vital to the French war effort, and the French Navy made constant attempts to evade the patrolling British squadrons.. In late 1808, a significant French squadron was deployed to Isle de France (now Mauritius) to disrupt British trade in the Indian Ocean.. This force required reinforcement and supply from France, and periodic attempts were made to reach the isolated convoy with new frigates, the first of which was \"Ni\u00e9men\".. \"Ni\u00e9men\" was a new and fast ship, carrying 40 guns and a large quantity of much needed naval supplies.. However, in order to leave her home port of Brest, it was necessary to avoid contact with the British frigates that constantly watched the entrance to the harbour in search of enemy movement..

Initially the U-boat campaign was directed against the British Grand Fleet.. Later U-boat fleet action was extended to include action against the trade routes of the Allied powers.. This campaign was highly destructive, and resulted in the loss of nearly half of Britain's merchant marine fleet during the course of the war.. To counter the German submarines, the Allies moved shipping into convoys guarded by destroyers, blockades such as the Dover Barrage and minefields were laid, and aircraft patrols monitored the U-boat bases.. The U-boat campaign was not able to cut off supplies before the US entered the war in 1917 and in later 1918, the U-boat bases were abandoned in the face of the Allied advance.. The tactical successes and failures of the Atlantic U-boat Campaign would later be used as a set of available tactics in World War II in a similar U-boat war against the British Empire.",

The campaign involved land and naval forces of Great Britain and France, and land forces of the United States.. British forces were sent to Virginia between January and April 1781 and joined with Cornwallis's army in May, which came north from an extended campaign through the southern states.. These forces were first opposed weakly by Virginia militia, but General George Washington sent first Marquis de Lafayette and then Anthony Wayne with Continental Army troops to oppose the raiding and economic havoc the British were wreaking.. The combined American forces, however, were insufficient in number to oppose the combined British forces, and it was only after a series of controversially confusing orders by General Sir Henry Clinton, the British commander-in-chief, that Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in July and built a defensive position that was strong against the land forces he then faced, but was vulnerable to naval blockade and siege.. British naval forces in North America and the West Indies were weaker than the combined fleets of France and Spain, and, after some critical decisions and tactical missteps by British naval commanders, the French fleet of Paul de Grasse gained control over Chesapeake Bay, blockading Cornwallis from naval support and delivering additional land forces to blockade him on land..

It is currently produced and aired by Klan TV.. K\u00ebnga Magjike was created by singer, composer, host and organizer Ardit Gjebrea and began airing in 1999.. It usually airs each November, with a few exceptions.. It was originally aired as a three or four night event similar to Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs; however, in 2005 a new format of presenting the songs was introduced.. Each song was broadcast one month prior to the semi-finals and the final in a special edition called \"Duke Pritur K\u00ebnga Magjike...\" (\"Awaiting K\u00ebnga Magjike...\"), giving the viewers a chance to vote for the songs that would pass on to the semi-finals through phone, text or online in the festival's official website.. A jury was also used when determining which songs made it to the next stage.. This format was later replaced by the current system, where groups of songs are presented weekly in the \"E Diela Shqiptare\" (\"The Albanian Sunday\") show on Klan TV hosted by Ardit Gjebrea.. Established singers automatically pass to the semi-finals stage, while newcomers must rely on the verdict of a professional jury.. Once the semi-finalists are determined and their acts are performed in the semis, it is the singers themselves who must vote for each other in a 1-through-30 (skipping 23, 25, 27, 28 and 29) point system to determine both the songs that will reach the finals and their final ranking.. The professional jury, the organizers of the festival and the TV station are tasked with determining the titles of the prizes that each finalist will be awarded.. Following criticism for the use of playback in the delivery of songs, the organizers decided to limit the use of playback to just the weekly presentation stage in 2015.. Established singers are allowed to use playback in this phase, while newcomers must sing live in order to receive a verdict by the jury.. Nonetheless, the semi-finals and the final must all be delivered live by both established and debuting singers.. The festival has been praised for the diversity of music it has brought to the public, providing a great mixture of singers and bands from Albania with those from neighboring countries, a large portion coming from Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and other areas.. K\u00ebnga Magjike has also been the stage for many comebacks of famous Albanian singers that reside in other countries, as well as artists which have contributed to the Albanian music industry in the past.. Songs from this contest have resulted in numerous memorable hits for Albanians throughout the world.. Compared to its main competitors, K\u00ebnga Magjike features more bubble-gum and commercialized music, contrasting with the predominantly alternative and rock genres featured in Top Awards on Top Channel, while not being as exclusively prohibitive as Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs, which typically admits only professional vocalists.. The main host of K\u00ebnga Magjike has always been Ardit Gjebrea.",

In particular, rebels in Cavite led by Mariano \u00c1lvarez and Emilio Aguinaldo (who were from two different factions of the Katipunan) won major early victories..

The war has been referred to as 'the dirty war' (\"la sale guerre\"), and saw extreme violence and brutality used against civilians.. Islamists targeted journalists, over 70 of whom were killed, and foreigners, over 100 of whom were killed, although it is thought by many that security forces as well as Islamists were involved, as the government infiltrated the insurgents.. Children were widely used, particularly by the rebel groups.. Total fatalities have been estimated to be a range of different values from 44,000 to between 100,000 and 200,000.. The conflict began in December 1991, when the new and enormously popular Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party appeared poised to defeat the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party in the national parliamentary elections.. The elections were canceled after the first round and the military effectively took control of the government, forcing pro-reform president Chadli Bendjedid from office.. After the FIS was banned and thousands of its members arrested, Islamist guerrillas rapidly emerged and began an armed campaign against the government and its supporters.. They formed themselves into various armed groups, principally the Islamic Armed Movement (MIA), based primarily in the mountains, and the more hard-line Armed Islamic Group (GIA), based primarily in the towns.. The GIA motto was \"no agreement, no truce, no dialogue\" and declared war on the FIS in 1994 after it made progress in negotiations with the government.. The MIA and various smaller insurgent bands regrouped, becoming the FIS-loyalist Islamic Salvation Army (AIS).. After talks collapsed, elections were held and won by the army's candidate, General Liamine Z\u00e9roual.. The GIA not only fought the AIS but began a series of massacres targeting entire neighborhoods or villages\u2014some evidence also suggests the involvement of government forces\u2014which peaked in 1997..

In the meantime 1997 parliamentary elections were won by a newly created pro-Army party supporting the president.. In 1999, following the election of Abdelaziz Bouteflika as president, violence declined as large numbers of insurgents \"repented\", taking advantage of a new amnesty law.. The remnants of the GIA proper were hunted down over the next two years, and had practically disappeared by 2002, with the exception of a splinter group called the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), which announced its support for Al-Qaeda in October 2003 and continued fighting an insurgency that would eventually spread to other countries in the region.",

The event sparked a series of political controversies where, in the end, the police officers were found guilty of murder and several high-ranking local government officials were accused of planning and/or covering up the incident.. Originally declared a police intervention against terrorists, the local media quickly questioned the officers' testimonies as well as the only surviving witness for inconsistencies.. Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3 (PNP), then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Justice Department to aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers' part.. However, after one of the local opposing political parties launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up.. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.. The incident and subsequent events have become one of the most controversial events in Puerto Rico's political history, frequently called \"the worst political cover-up in the history of the island\".. The event is often used by Puerto Rican independence activists as an example of political oppression against the independence movement.. Joy James commented that \"the Cerro Maravilla massacre demonstrated the reason why colonialism was banned in the world.\"",

The shoot-down occurred in the War in Donbass, during the Battle of Shakhtarsk, in an area controlled by pro-Russian rebels.. The crash was Malaysia Airlines' second aircraft loss during 2014 after the disappearance of Flight 370 on 8 March.. The responsibility for investigation was delegated to the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) and the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), who concluded that the airliner was downed by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.. According to the JIT, the Buk that was used originated from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation, and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash, fired from a field in a rebel-controlled area, and the launcher returned to Russia after it was used to shoot down MH17.. On the basis of the JIT's conclusions, the governments of the Netherlands and Australia hold Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation and are taking steps to hold Russia formally accountable.. The DSB and JIT findings confirmed earlier claims by American and German intelligence sources as to the missile type and launch area.. In 2014, American intelligence had also said that Russia had supplied the Buk missile to pro-Russian insurgents, and that the insurgents most plausibly shot down MH17 in error, after misidentifying it as a military aircraft.. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk laid the blame on professional soldiers who came from Russia with Ukrainian passports and were coordinated from Russia.. , the Russian government rejects claims that Russia bears any responsibility for the crash, and denies involvement.. The Russian defense ministry said that it had never deployed anti-aircraft missile systems in Ukraine.. Several conspiracy theories about the crash have since appeared in Russian media, including that the aircraft was followed by a Ukrainian military jet.. The Russian Government holds Ukraine responsible for the crash, asserting that Ukraine should have redirected the civilian traffic away from the area of conflict.. Several Ukrainian Air Force (UAF) aircraft had been shot down over the rebel-controlled territory, before the MH17 incident..

Both unionists and Irish nationalists were killed and injured.. As a result of the bombing, new anti-terrorism laws were swiftly instated by both the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.. It has been alleged that the British, Irish, and US intelligence agencies had information which could have prevented the bombing, most of which came from double agents inside the Real IRA, but this information was not given to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).. In 2008 it was revealed that British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring conversations between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh.. A 2001 report by the Police Ombudsman said that the RUC Special Branch failed to act on prior warnings and criticised the RUC's investigation of the bombing.. Police reportedly obtained circumstantial and coincidental evidence against some suspects, but have not come up with enough to convict anyone of the bombing.",

There is some dispute among historians about the dates for the beginning and end of the battle and British histories usually treat 10 July as the beginning.. British and German writers and historians acknowledge that air battles were fought over the Channel between the Battle of France and Britain; deliberate German attacks against British coastal targets and convoys began on 4 July.. During the \"Kanalkampf\", the \"Luftwaffe\" received modest support from shore artillery and the E-Boats of the \"Kriegsmarine\" (German navy).. Fighter Command could not protect adequately the convoys; the Germans sank several British and neutral ships and shot down a considerable number of British fighters.. The Royal Navy was forced to suspend the sailing of large convoys in Channel waters and close it to ocean-going vessels until more protection could be arranged, which took several weeks.. On 1 August, Hitler issued Directive 17, extending \"Luftwaffe\" operations to the British mainland and RAF-related targets and on \"Adlertag\" (Eagle Day, 13 August) the main air offensive against the RAF began.. The \"Kanalkampf\" had drawn out Fighter Command as intended and convoy attacks continued for several more days.. Both sides had suffered losses but the \"Luftwaffe\" failed to inflict a decisive defeat on Fighter Command and the RAF; the \"Luftwaffe\" had yet to gain air superiority for Operation Sea Lion.",

General Sir Harold Alexander, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in Italy, planned \"Diadem\" to coordinate roughly with the invasion of Normandy, so that German forces would be tied down in Italy, and could not be redeployed to France.. Four corps were employed in the attack.. From right to left these were the Polish II Corps and the British XIII Corps, of the Eighth Army, and the Free French Corps (including Moroccan \"Goumiers\") and the U.S. II Corps, of the Fifth Army.. The Fifth Army also controlled the U.S. VI Corps in the Anzio beachhead, some 60 miles northwest.. \"Diadem\" was launched at 23:00 pm on 11 May 1944 by elements of the British 4th Infantry Division and 8th Indian Infantry Division, with supporting fire from the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade.. They made a successful strongly opposed night crossing of the Garigliano and Rapido rivers.. This broke into the heart of the German defenses in the Liri valley against strong opposition and drew in German theater reserves, reducing pressure on the Anzio beachhead.. The Free French Corps pushed through the mountains to the left on 14 May, supported by U.S. II Corps along the coast.. On 17 May, Polish II Corps on the right attacked Monte Cassino.. When their position collapsed, the Germans fell back from the Gustav Line to the Hitler Line some 10 miles to their rear.. On 23 May, the four corps attacked the Hitler Line.. On the same day, the U.S. VI Corps attacked out of the Anzio beachhead.. The Hitler Line was breached by the 1st Canadian Infantry Division's 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards at Pontecorvo on 23 May.. The German Tenth Army was forced to retire northwestward.. The U.S. VI Corps, moving northeast from Anzio, was at the point of cutting off the German line of retreat when Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the Fifth Army, inexplicably ordered them to turn northwest and advance on Rome instead.. There is much speculation that he did this so that his Fifth Army would capture Rome ahead of the Eighth Army advancing up the Liri Valley.. The German Tenth Army thus avoided being surrounded..

According to the official Air Force report, the aircraft experienced an uncontrolled decompression that required it to descend to in order to lower the cabin altitude.. Increased fuel consumption caused by having to fly at lower altitude, combined with the inability to rendezvous with a tanker in time caused the aircraft to run out of fuel.. The aircrew ejected safely, and then the unmanned aircraft crashed west of Yuba City, tearing the nuclear weapons from the aircraft on impact.. However, in a 2012 book LTC Earl McGill, a retired SAC B-52 pilot, claims that the aircrew, after an inflight refueling session that provided inadequate fuel, refused the offer of an additional, unscheduled inflight refueling, bypassed possible emergency landing fields and ran out of fuel.. The crew ejected, the aircraft broke up and four onboard nuclear weapons were released.. The weapons' multiple safety interlocks prevented both a nuclear explosion and release of radioactive material.. LTC McGill, based on his SAC experience, blames the aircrew failures on the use of dexedrine to overcome tiredness on the 24-hour flight preceding the accident..

The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the Grande Arm\u00e9e lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Russo-Austrian force under Tsar Alexander I at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December.. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.. On 26 December 1805, Austria and France signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition, while it reinforced the earlier treaties between the two powers of Campo Formio and of Lun\u00e9ville.. The treaty confirmed the Austrian cession of lands in Italy and Bavaria to France and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies, imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs, and allowed the defeated Russian troops free passage, with their arms and equipment, through hostile territories and back to their home soil.. Victory at Austerlitz also permitted the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and central Europe.. As a direct consequence of these events, the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist when, in 1806, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II abdicated the Imperial throne, emerging as Francis I, Emperor of Austria..

The prevalent Portuguese and international historical approach considers the Portuguese Colonial War as was perceived at the time: a single conflict fought in three separate theaters of operations: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique (sometimes including the 1961 Indian Annexation of Goa) rather than a number of separate conflicts as the emergent African countries aided each other during the war.. Unlike other European nations during the 1950s and 1960s, the Portuguese Estado Novo regime did not withdraw from its African colonies, or the overseas provinces (\"prov\u00edncias ultramarinas\") as those territories had been officially called since 1951.. During the 1960s, various armed independence movements became active: the  People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, National Liberation Front of Angola, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in Angola, African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde in Portuguese Guinea, and the Mozambique Liberation Front in Mozambique.. During the ensuing conflict, atrocities were committed by all forces involved.. Throughout the period Portugal faced increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by the international community.. By 1973, the war had become increasingly unpopular due to its length and financial costs, the worsening of diplomatic relations with other United Nations members, and the role it had always played as a factor of perpetuation of the entrenched Estado Novo regime and the non-democratic status quo.. The end of the war came with the Carnation Revolution military coup of April 1974.. The withdrawal resulted in the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Portuguese citizens plus military personnel of European, African and mixed ethnicity from the former Portuguese territories and newly independent African nations.. This migration is regarded as one of the largest peaceful migrations in the world's history.. The former colonies faced severe problems after independence.",

As the war progressed from its initial invasion phase in 2003 to a nearly decade-long occupation, American public opinion shifted towards favoring a troop withdrawal; in May 2007, 55% of Americans believed that the Iraq War was a mistake, and 51% of registered voters favored troop withdrawal.. In late April 2007 Congress passed a supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a deadline for troop withdrawal but President Bush vetoed this bill, citing his concerns about setting a withdrawal deadline.. The Bush Administration later sought an agreement with the Iraqi government, and in 2008 George W. Bush signed the U.S.\u2013Iraq Status of Forces Agreement..

From 1944 each side targeted the power vacuum resulting from the end of Axis occupation (1941\u20131944) during World War II.. The struggle became one of the first conflicts of the Cold War ( 1947 to 1989) and represents the first example of Cold War power postwar involvement in the internal politics of a foreign country.. Greece in the end was funded by the US (through the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan) and joined NATO (1952), while the insurgents were demoralized by the bitter split between the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, who wanted the war ended, and Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito, who wanted it to continue.. Tito was committed to helping the Greek Communists in their efforts, a stance that caused political complications with Stalin, as he had recently agreed with Winston Churchill not to support the Communists in Greece, as documented in their Percentages Agreement of October 1944.. The first signs of the civil war occurred in 1942 to 1944, during the German occupation.. With the Greek government in exile unable to influence the situation at home, various resistance groups of differing political affiliations emerged, the dominant ones being the leftist National Liberation Front (EAM), and its military branch the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) which was effectively controlled by the KKE.. Starting in autumn 1943, friction between the EAM and the other resistance groups resulted in scattered clashes, which continued until spring 1944, when an agreement was reached forming a national unity government that included six EAM-affiliated ministers.. The immediate prelude of the civil war took place in Athens, on December 3, 1944, less than two months after the Germans had retreated from the area.. After an order to disarm, leftists resigned from the government and called for resistance.. A riot (the \"Dekemvriana\") erupted and Greek government gendarmes, with British forces standing in the background, opened fire on a pro-EAM rally, killing 28 demonstrators and injuring dozens.. The rally had been organised under the pretext of a demonstration against the perceived impunity of the collaborators and the general disarmament ultimatum, signed by Ronald Scobie (the British commander in Greece).",

Arabs opposition developed into the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine, while the Jewish resistance developed into the Jewish insurgency in Palestine (1944\u20131947).. In 1947, these on-going tensions erupted into civil war following the 29 November 1947 adoption of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which planned to divide Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state, and the Special International Regime encompassing the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.. On 15 May 1948, the civil war transformed into a conflict between Israel and the Arab states following the Israeli Declaration of Independence the previous day.. Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and expeditionary forces from Iraq entered Palestine, even though Jordan had declared privately to Yishuv emissaries on 2 May that it would not attack the Jewish state.. The invading forces took control of the Arab areas and immediately attacked Israeli forces and several Jewish settlements.. The 10 months of fighting took place mostly on the territory of the British Mandate and in the Sinai Peninsula and southern Lebanon, interrupted by several truce periods.. As a result of the war, the State of Israel controlled the area that UN General Assembly Resolution 181 had recommended for the proposed Jewish state, as well as almost 60-percent of the area of Arab state proposed by the 1947 Partition Plan, including the Jaffa, Lydda, and Ramle area, Galilee, some parts of the Negev, a wide strip along the Tel Aviv\u2013Jerusalem road, West Jerusalem, and some territories in the West Bank.. Transjordan took control of the remainder of the former British mandate, which it annexed, and the Egyptian military took control of the Gaza Strip..

Josephine strengthened further and peaked as a moderately strong Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on October 12.. On the following day, Josephine weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane before becoming nearly stationary.. It later headed northeastward and paralleled the coast well offshore of Nova Scotia.. By October 17, Josephine weakened back to a tropical storm, shortly before beginning to execute a cyclonic loop to the south of Newfoundland.. While executing the cyclonic loop, Josephine became extratropical on October 18.. Although Josephine remained well offshore of the eastern United States, the effects from the storm and an area of high pressure produced strong winds and high seas along the coast.. In North Carolina, high tides caused severe beach erosion and minor damage to ocean-front houses.. Minor coastal flooding occurred in New York and New Jersey.. In addition, one fatality occurred when a man drowned after falling off his boat while sailing a river in Massachusetts.",

It attained gale-force winds and was named \"Mala\" the next day.. Conditions for strengthening improved markedly on April 27 and Mala subsequently underwent rapid intensification which culminated in the cyclone attaining its peak.. Early on April 28, the cyclone had estimated winds of 185 km/h (115 mph).. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered Mala to have been slightly stronger, classifying it as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone.. Steady weakening ensued thereafter and the storm made landfall in Myanmar's Rakhine State on April 29.. Rapid dissipation took place once onshore and Mala was last noted early the next morning.. In contrast to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized loss of life along the coast.. The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near Yangon on April 28 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone.. A total of 586 homes were damaged there..

Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066, and were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later.. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold's only serious opponent.. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom.. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.. The exact numbers present at the battle are unknown; modern estimates are around 10,000 for William and about 7,000 for Harold.. The composition of the forces is clearer; the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers.. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold.. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk.. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect; therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers.. Harold's death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army.. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.. There continued to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England..

      "context": "In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire.. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias.. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese.. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse, Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force in 413 BC.. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War.. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from the Achaemenid Empire, supported rebellions in Athens's subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens's empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy.. The destruction of Athens's fleet in the Battle of Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year.. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused.. The term \"Peloponnesian War\" was never used by Thucydides, by far its major historian: that the term is all but universally used today is a reflection of the Athens-centric sympathies of modern historians.. As prominent historian J.. B.. Bury remarks, the Peloponnesians would have considered it the \"Attic War\".. The Peloponnesian War reshaped the ancient Greek world.. On the level of international relations, Athens, the strongest city-state in Greece prior to the war's beginning, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection, while Sparta became established as the leading power of Greece.. The economic costs of the war were felt all across Greece; poverty became widespread in the Peloponnese, while Athens found itself completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity.. The war also wrought subtler changes to Greek society; the conflict between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made civil war a common occurrence in the Greek world.. Ancient Greek warfare, meanwhile, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, was transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale.. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities, the Peloponnesian War marked the dramatic end to the fifth century BC and the golden age of Greece.. The Peloponnesian War was soon followed by the Corinthian War (394-386 BC), which, although it ended inconclusively, helped Athens regain a little of its former greatness.",

Despite a projected track toward landfall in Louisiana or Texas, the storm headed the opposite direction, moving slowly north-northeast and northeastward.. The storm slowly strengthened, and at 1800 UTC on June 25, attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h).. Dry air, westerly wind shear, and upwelling of cold waters prevented further intensification over the next 24 hours.. Instead, Debby weakened, and by late on June 26, it was a minimal tropical storm.. At 2100 UTC, the storm made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).. Once inland, the system continued to weaken while crossing Florida, and dissipated shortly after emerging into the Atlantic on June 27.. The storm dropped immense amounts of precipitation near its path.. Rainfall peaked at in Curtis Mill, Florida, located in southwestern Wakulla County.. The Sopchoppy River, which reached its record height, flooded at least 400 structures in Wakulla County.",

As tensions swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, violence finally broke out in Powder River Country, when the ranchers hired gunmen to invade the county.. The gunmen's initial incursion in the territory aroused the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling stand-off.. The siege ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted in the following months.. The events have since become a highly mythologized and symbolic story of the Wild West, and over the years variations of the storyline have come to include some of its most famous historical figures.. In addition to being one of the most well-known range wars of the American frontier, its themes, especially class warfare, served as a basis for numerous popular novels, films, and television shows in the Western genre.",
