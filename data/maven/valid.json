Their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the French, British, and Americans asserted territorial claims on the area.. French and British traders had mixed with native society in the area for many decades peacefully contributing to the society and creating new ethnic groups consisting of mixed-race peoples.. As the Americans established outposts in the area and the fur trade declined, the dynamics changed dramatically.. The economic influence of the Native Americans diminished and American territorial ideology increasingly sought to limit their influence.. Large waves of immigration in the 1850s very suddenly changed the demographics so that within a few years the population shifted from predominantly native to predominantly people of European descent.. The native and mixed-race populations continued to influence the territory's culture and politics, even at the end of the territorial era, though by the time statehood was achieved that influence was in steep decline..

The Battle of Madrid in November 1936 saw the most intense fighting in and around the city when the Nationalists made their most determined attempt to take the Republican capital.. The highest military awards of the Spanish Republic, the Laureate Plate of Madrid () and the Madrid Distinction (), established by the Republican government in order to reward courage, were named after the capital of Spain owing to the city symbolizing valour and Antifascist resistance during the long siege throughout the Civil War.. Uprising \u2014 Madrid held for the Republic (July 1936).. The Spanish Civil War began with a failed \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" against the Popular Front Government of the Spanish Republic by right-wing Spanish Army officers on 18 July 1936.. In Madrid, the Republican government was unsure of what to do.. It wanted to put down the coup, but was unsure if it could trust the armed forces and did not want to arm the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade unions and potentially accelerate the ongoing Spanish revolution.. On 18 July, the government sent units of the Guardia Civil to Seville to put down the rebellion there.. However, on reaching the city the guardias defected to the insurgents.. On 19 July Santiago Casares Quiroga resigned as Prime Minister, to be succeeded by Diego Martinez Barrio.. He tried to arrange a truce with the insurgent general Emilio Mola by telephone, but Mola refused the offer and Martinez Barrio was ousted as Prime Minister by Jos\u00e9 Giral.. Giral agreed to arm the trade unionists in defence of the Republic, and had 60,000 rifles delivered to the CNT and UGT headquarters, although only 5,000 were in working order.. In a radio broadcast on the 18th, the communist leader Dolores Ibarruri coined the famous slogan \"\u00a1No pasar\u00e1n!\". (\"They shall not pass\"), urging resistance against the coup.. The slogan was to become synonymous with the defence of Madrid and the Republican cause in general.. At the same time, General Joaqu\u00edn Fanjul, commander of the military garrison based in Monta\u00f1a barracks in Madrid, was preparing to launch the military rebellion in the city.. However, when he tried to march out of the barracks, his 2,500 troops were forced back inside the compound by hostile crowds and armed trade unionists.. On the 20th, the barracks was stormed by a mixture of workers and \"Guardias de Asalto\" (\"assault guards\", an urban police force) loyal to the government, as well as five battalions of the Communist-led Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias (MAOC) \u2014one of these battalions became the famous \"Fifth Regiment\"\u2014 totaling about 10,000 fighters.. The fighting was chaotic, and on several occasions some soldiers within the barracks indicated their willingness to surrender, only for other troops to keep firing at the attackers, killing those who had broken cover to take them prisoner.. Eventually the barracks fell when the \"Guardias de Asalto\" brought up a 75 mm field gun to bombard the complex and its gate was opened by a sapper sergeant sympathetic to the Republican side.. The sergeant was killed by one of his officers, but his action allowed the Republicans to breach the walls.. A number of soldiers were massacred by the crowd, enraged by the apparent false surrenders, after the fall of the barracks.. Thereafter and for the remainder of the war, Madrid was held by the Republicans.. However, its population contained a significant number of right-wing sympathisers.. Over 20,000 right-wingers sought refuge in foreign embassies in the city.. The weeks that followed the July uprising, saw a number of so-called fascists or fascist sympathisers being killed in Madrid by Republicans.. For example, on 23 August 70 prisoners from the \"Modelo\" Prison in the city were massacred in revenge for the Nationalist killing of over 1,500 Republicans after the storming of Badajoz.. Nationalist \"Drive on Madrid\" (August\u2013October 1936).. The initial strategy of the military plot had been to assume power all over the country in the manner of a \"Pronunciamiento\" (military coup) of the 19th century.. However, the resistance to the coup by Republicans meant that instead of this, Franco and his allies would have to conquer the country by military force if they wanted to seize power.. Franco himself had landed in Algeciras in southern Spain with Moroccan troops from the Spanish Army of Africa.. Mola, who was in command of the colonial troops as well as the Spanish Foreign Legion and Carlist and Falangist militia, raised troops in the north.. Together, they planned a \"Drive on Madrid\" to take the Spanish capital, Franco advancing from Badajoz, which he took in August and Mola from Burgos.. Franco's veteran colonial troops, or \"regulares\", under General Yague, along with air cover supplied by Nazi Germany, routed the Republican militias in their path.. Yague argued for a rapid advance on Madrid, but Franco overruled him in favour of relieving the Nationalist troops besieged in Toledo.. This diversion held up their attack on Madrid by up to a month \u2014 giving the Republicans time to prepare its defence.. Meanwhile, in the city, the Republican government had reformed under the leadership of socialist leader Francisco Largo Caballero.. Caballero's government included six Socialist party ministers, two Communists, two from the Republican Left party, one from the Catalan Left party, one Basque Nationalist Party and one Republican Union minister.. Although the communists were a minority in the government, they gained in influence through their access to arms from the USSR and foreign volunteers in the International Brigades.. The Republican military commander in Madrid was nominally a Spanish general, Jose Miaja, but Soviet military personnel were perhaps more important.",

However, two weeks later a Bulgarian representative to the European Union revealed that investigators discovered new evidence that implicates Hezbollah operatives were connected to the terrorist attacks.. Investigators found that the forged documents used by the perpetrators of the attack were facilitated by a man with ties to Hezbollah.. In July 2013, the newly appointed Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetlin Yovchev stated: \"there are clear signs that say Hezbollah is behind the Burgas bombing.\"",

Grassroots community assemblies called 'Soviets', which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias.. A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of Soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class..

The operation was carried out by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury's 1st Parachute Brigade, part of the British 1st Airborne Division.. Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River.. The intention was for the brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land on both sides of the river.. They would then capture the bridge and secure the surrounding area until relieved by the advance of British XIII Corps, which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously.. Because the bridge was the only crossing on the river and would give the British Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, its capture was expected to speed the advance and lead to the defeat of the Axis forces in Sicily.. Many of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down or were damaged and turned back by friendly fire and enemy action.. Evasive action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area and only the equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in the correct locations.. Despite this and the defence by German and Italian forces, the British paratroops captured the bridge, repulsed attacks and held out against increasing odds until nightfall.. The relief force led by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, under Major-General Sidney C. Kirkman, which was short of transport, were still away when they halted for the night.. By this time, with casualties mounting and supplies running short, the parachute brigade commander, Gerald Lathbury, had relinquished control of the bridge to the Germans.. The following day the British units joined forces and the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, with tank support, attempted to recapture the bridge.. The bridge was not finally secured until three days after the start of the operation, when another battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, led by the paratroopers, established a bridgehead on the north bank of the river.",

It is the only Category 5 Atlantic hurricane ever recorded in November, as well as the strongest November hurricane on record in the Atlantic Basin.. The cyclone had a path through the Caribbean Sea atypical to most hurricanes developing late in the Atlantic hurricane season.. The storm's strong winds, storm surge, and rain devastated an extensive portion of central and eastern Cuba, where the storm was considered the worst natural disaster of the 20th century.. Though the effects from the hurricane were concentrated primarily on Cuba, significant effects were also felt in the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas, with lesser effects felt elsewhere.. The tropical depression that would later develop into the destructive hurricane was first located east of the Lesser Antilles on October 30, and tracked westward into the Caribbean Sea, reaching tropical storm strength the next day.. Moving southwestward towards the southern portion of the Caribbean, the storm reached hurricane strength on November 2 before a period of rapid intensification ensued.. On November 6, the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h).. The storm weakened to Category 4 intensity while recurving northeast, moving ashore Cuba's Camag\u00fcey Province on November 9 with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h).. After traversing the island, the storm gradually weakened as it crossed the central Bahamas Islands and near Bermuda..

It is also called the Jacobite War in Ireland or the Williamite\u2013Jacobite War in Ireland.. The proximate cause of the war was the Glorious Revolution of 1688, in which James, a Catholic, was overthrown as king of the Three Kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland and replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary and nephew and son-in-law William, ruling as joint monarchs.. James's supporters initially retained control of Ireland, which he hoped to use as a base for a campaign to reclaim all three kingdoms; however, the conflict in Ireland also involved longstanding domestic issues of land ownership and religious and civic rights, and many Irish Catholics supported James in the hope he would address their grievances.. A small number of English and Scottish Catholics, and Protestants of the established Church in Ireland, also fought on the Jacobite side, while many Irish Protestants supported or actively fought for William\u2019s regime.. While the war's Irish name emphasises its aspect as a domestic conflict between James and William, some contemporaries and many modern commentators have viewed it as part of a wider European conflict known as the Nine Years' War or War of the Grand Alliance in which William, as Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, led a multi-national coalition against France under Louis XIV.. William\u2019s deposition of James was partly driven by his need to control and mobilise English military and commercial power, while Louis provided limited material support to the Jacobites: both sides were aware of the Irish war's potential to divert military resources from the Continent.. The war began with a series of skirmishes between James\u2019s Irish Army, which had stayed loyal in 1688, and militia forces raised by Irish Protestants: they culminated in the Siege of Derry, where the Jacobites failed to regain control of one of the north\u2019s key towns.. William landed a force including English, Scottish, Dutch, Danish and other troops to put down Jacobite resistance.. James left Ireland after a reverse at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, as did William after a successful Jacobite defence of Limerick; the remaining Jacobite forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691, and negotiated terms in the Treaty of Limerick.",

In the initial stages,the movement had the support of Mahatma Gandhi and other congress/ national movement leaders, a number of minor clashes took place between Khilafat volunteers and the police, but the violence soon spread across the region.. The Mappilas attacked and took control of police stations, British government offices, courts and government treasuries.. The British Government put down the rebellion with an iron fist, British and Gurkha regiments were sent to the area and Martial Law imposed.. One of the most noteworthy events during the suppression later came to be known as the \"Wagon tragedy\", in which 67 out of a total of 90 Mappila prisoners destined for the Central Prison in Podanur suffocated to death in a closed railway goods wagon.. For six months from August 1921, the rebellion extended over  \u2013 some 40% of the South Malabar region of the Madras Presidency.. An estimated 10,000 people lost their lives, although official figures put the numbers at 2337 rebels killed, 1652 injured and 45,404 imprisoned.. Unofficial estimates put the number imprisoned at almost 50,000 of whom 20,000 were deported, mainly to the penal colony in the Andaman Islands, while around 10,000 went missing.. The most prominent leaders of the rebellion were Variankunnath Kunjahammad Haji, Sithi Koya Thangal and Ali Musliyar.. Contemporary British administrators and modern historians differ markedly in their assessment of the incident, debating whether the revolts were triggered off by religious fanaticism or agrarian grievances.. At the time, the Indian National Congress repudiated the movement and it remained isolated from the wider nationalist movement.. However, contemporary Indian evaluations now view the rebellion as a national upheaval against British authority and the most important event concerning the political movement in Malabar during the period.. In its magnitude and extent, it was an unprecedented popular upheaval, the likes of which has not been seen in Kerala before or since.. While the Mappilas were in the vanguard of the movement and bore the brunt of the struggle, several non-Mappila leaders actively sympathised with the rebels' cause, giving the uprising the character of a national upheaval..

      "context": "The first Mongol invasions of Burma (present-day Myanmar) () were a series of military conflicts between Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty, division of the Mongol Empire, and the Pagan Empire that took place between 1277 and 1287.. The invasions toppled the 250-year-old Pagan Empire, and the Mongol army seized Pagan territories in present-day Dehong, Yunnan and northern Burma to Tagaung.. The invasions ushered in 250 years of political fragmentation in Burma and the rise of ethnic Tai-Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia.. The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271\u201372, as part of their drive to encircle the Song dynasty of China.. When King Narathihapate refused, Emperor Kublai Khan himself sent another mission in 1273, again demanding tribute.. It too was rejected.. In 1275, the emperor ordered the Yunnan government to secure the borderlands in order to block an escape path for the Song, and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested.. Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the Mongol Army in 1277\u201378.. After a brief lull, Kublai Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia, demanding tribute from Pagan, the Khmer Empire, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and Champa.. When the Burmese king again refused, the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma.. Two dry season campaigns (1283\u201385) later, the Mongols had occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin, forcing the Burmese king to flee to Lower Burma.. The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of Zhengmian.. Ceasefire negotiations began in 1285, and ended with Narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in June 1286.. The Burmese embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in January 1287, agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the suzerainty of the Yuan dynasty or the Mongol Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the Yunnan government in exchange for the evacuation of Mongol troops from northern Burma.. But the treaty never really took effect as Narathihapate was assassinated in July 1287, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged.. The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma.. They may not have reached Pagan, and even if they did, after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to Tagaung.. The Pagan Empire disintegrated and anarchy ensued.. The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years.. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan (Bagan).. But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300\u201301..

In 1115, Jurchen tribes rebelled against their overlords, the Khitan Liao dynasty (907\u20131125), and declared the formation of the Jin.. Allying with the Song against their common enemy the Liao dynasty, the Jin promised to return to the Song the Sixteen Prefectures that had fallen under Liao control since 938.. The Chinese agreed but the Jurchens' quick defeat of the Liao dynasty combined with Song dynasty military failures made the Jin reluctant to cede these territories.. After a series of negotiations that embittered both sides, the Jurchens attacked the Song dynasty in 1125, dispatching one army to Taiyuan and the other to Bianjing (modern Kaifeng), the Song capital.. Surprised by news of an invasion, Song general Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan, which was besieged and later captured.. As the second Jin army approached the capital, Song emperor Huizong abdicated and fled south.. Qinzong, his eldest son, was enthroned.. The Jurchens laid siege to Kaifeng in 1126, but Qinzong negotiated their retreat from the capital by agreeing to a large annual indemnity.. Qinzong reneged on the deal and ordered Song forces to defend the prefectures instead of fortifying the capital.. The Jin resumed war and again besieged Kaifeng in 1127.. They captured Emperor Qinzong of Song, many members of the imperial family and high officials of the Song imperial court in an event known as the Jingkang Incident.. This separated north and south China between Jin and Song.. Remnants of the Song imperial family retreated to southern China and, after brief stays in several temporary capitals, eventually relocated to Lin'an (modern Hangzhou).. The retreat divided the dynasty into two distinct periods, Northern Song and Southern Song.. The Jurchens tried to conquer southern China in the 1130s, but were bogged down by a pro-Song insurgency in the north and a counteroffensive by Song generals Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and others.. The Song generals regained some territories but retreated on the orders of Southern Song emperor Gaozong, who supported a peaceful resolution to the war.. The Treaty of Shaoxing (1142) set the boundary of the two empires along the Huai River, but conflicts between the two dynasties continued until the fall of the Jin in 1234.. A war against the Song begun by 4th Jin emperor, Wanyan Liang, was unsuccessful.. He lost the Battle of Caishi (1161) and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers.. An invasion of Jin territory motivated by Song revanchism (1206\u20131208) was also unsuccessful.. A decade later, the Jin launched an abortive military campaign against the Song in 1217 to replace territory they had lost to the invading Mongols.. The Song allied with the Mongols in 1233, and in the next year jointly captured Caizhou, last refuge of the Jin emperor.. The Jin dynasty collapsed that year in 1234.. After the demise of the Jin, the Song dynasty itself became a target of the Mongols, and collapsed in 1279.. The wars engendered an era of swift technological, cultural, and demographic changes in China.. Battles between the Song and Jin brought about the introduction of various gunpowder weapons.",

After the restoration of rule by Ferdinand VII in 1814, and his rejection of the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, the monarchy as well as liberals hardened their stance toward its overseas possessions, and they in turn increasingly sought political independence.. The violent conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito in opposing the government of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville.. In 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas when the Central Junta fell to the French invasion.. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to many crown policies, \"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\". While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary, most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a means to preserve the region's autonomy from the French.. Over the course of the next decade, the political instability in Spain and the absolutist restoration under Ferdinand VII convinced many Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the mother country.. These conflicts were fought both as irregular warfare and conventional warfare, and as wars of national liberation and civil wars.. The conflicts among the colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina, Chile, and Peru in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century..

In the history of naval warfare, Lepanto marks the last major engagement in the Western world to be fought almost entirely between rowing vessels, namely the galleys and galeasses which were the direct descendants of ancient trireme warships.. The battle was in essence an \"infantry battle on floating platforms\".. It was the largest naval battle in Western history since classical antiquity, involving more than 400 warships.. Over the following decades, the increasing importance of the galleon and the line of battle tactic would displace the galley as the major warship of its era, marking the beginning of the \"Age of Sail\".. The victory of the Holy League is of great importance in the history of Europe and of the Ottoman Empire, marking the turning-point of Ottoman military expansion into the Mediterranean, although the Ottoman wars in Europe would continue for another century.. It has long been compared to the Battle of Salamis, both for tactical parallels and for its crucial importance in the defense of Europe against imperial expansion.. It was also of great symbolic importance in a period when Europe was torn by its own wars of religion following the Protestant Reformation..

Gates found the front door to his home jammed shut and, with the help of his driver, tried to force it open.. A local witness reported their activity to the police as a potential burglary in progress.. Accounts regarding the ensuing confrontation differ, but Gates was arrested by the responding officer, Cambridge Police Sgt.. James Crowley, and charged with disorderly conduct.. On July 21, the charges against Gates were dropped.. The arrest generated a national debate about whether or not it represented an example of racial profiling by police.. On July 22, President Barack Obama said about the incident, \"I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that.. But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home, and, number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.\". Law enforcement organizations and members objected to Obama's comments and criticized his handling of the issue.. In the aftermath, Obama stated that he regretted his comments and hoped that the situation could become a \"teachable moment\".. On July 24, Obama invited both parties to the White House to discuss the issue over beer, and on July 30, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden joined Crowley and Gates in a private, cordial meeting in a courtyard near the White House Rose Garden; this became known colloquially as the \"Beer Summit\".",

The Ukrainian Insurgent Army continued its guerilla activities until 1947 in both Subcarpathian and Lublin Voivodeships with no hope for any peaceful resolution.. Operation Vistula effectively brought an end to the hostilities.. In a period of three months beginning on 28 April 1947 and with Soviet approval and aid, about 141,000 civilians residing around Bieszczady and Low Beskids were forcibly resettled to formerly German territories, ceded to Poland at the Yalta Conference at the end of World War II.. The operation was named after the Vistula River, \"Wis\u0142a\" in Polish.. Some Polish and Ukrainian politicians as well as historians condemned the operation following the 1989 fall of communism in Eastern Europe, and described it as ethnic cleansing.. Others pointed out that no other means of stopping the violence existed at the time since partisans used to regroup outside the Polish borders.. During Operation Vistula the conditions of the United Nations Charter of 26 June 1945, on the right of self-determination and international laws, were respected.. The deported farmers received financial help from the Polish government and took over homes and farms left behind by the Germans, in some cases experiencing an improvement in their living conditions as a result of the increased size of the newly acquired properties, their brick construction, and the provision of running water.. In the years 1956 to 1958 they received mostly non-repayable credits totalling 170 million PLN which was a considerable amount of money in the Polish national budget.. At exactly the same time the Soviet Union carried out a parallel operation, dubbed \"Operation West\", in the Ukrainian SSR by the Soviet Union at exactly the same time.. Although both operations were coordinated from Moscow, there was a shocking difference between their outcomes.. Operation West was conducted in West Ukraine by the Soviet NKVD and targeted the families of suspected UPA members..

William Overholt, a Hong Kong-based political economist said that \"It is either being called mob rule or mob rule as a cover for a well-planned coup, ... but either way, it's not democracy.\". It should also be noted that opinion was divided during EDSA II about whether Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as the incumbent Vice President should be President if Joseph Estrada was ousted; many groups who participated in EDSA II expressly stated that they did not want Arroyo for president either, and some of them would later participate in EDSA III.. The prevailing Constitution of the Philippines calls for the Vice President of the Philippines, Arroyo at the time, to act as interim president only when the sitting President dies, resigns, or becomes incapacitated, none of which occurred during EDSA II.. On October 4, 2000, Ilocos Sur Governor Luis \"Chavit\" Singson, a longtime friend of President Joseph Estrada, went public with accusations that Estrada, his family and friends received millions of pesos from operations of the illegal numbers game, \"jueteng\".. The expos\u00e9 immediately ignited reactions of rage.. The next day, Senate Minority Leader Teofisto Guingona, Jr. delivered a fiery privilege speech accusing Estrada of receiving P220 million in jueteng money from Governor Singson from November 1998 to August 2000, as well as taking P70 million on excise tax on cigarettes intended for Ilocos Sur.. The privilege speech was referred by Senate President Franklin Drilon, to the Blue Ribbon Committee and the Committee on Justice for joint investigation.. Another committee in the House of Representatives decided to investigate the expos\u00e9, while other house members spearheaded a move to impeach the president.. More calls for resignation came from Manila Cardinal Archbishop Jaime Sin, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, former Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos, and Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (who had resigned her cabinet position of Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development).. Cardinal Sin stated in a statement \"In the light of the scandals that besmirched the image of presidency, in the last two years, we stand by our conviction that he has lost the moral authority to govern.\". More resignations came from Estrada's cabinet and economic advisers, and other members of congress defected from his ruling party.. On November 13, 2000, the House of Representatives led by Speaker Manuel Villar transmitted the Articles of Impeachment, signed by 115 representatives, to the Senate..

It accounted for the majority of civilian and military casualties in the Pacific War, with between 10 and 25 million Chinese civilians and over 4 million Chinese and Japanese military personnel dying from war-related violence, famine, and other causes..

Rammasun posed a significant threat to the Philippine island of Luzon, as it was expected to reach typhoon intensity before making landfall there.. Though initially forecast to make landfall in Cagayan Valley, the storm followed a more westerly path and was later forecast to make landfall in the Bicol Region and then pass through Bataan and Zambales before brushing past Metro Manila.. In preparation for the storm, Governor of Guam Eddie Calvo declared the island in Condition of Readiness 3 and later upgraded it to Condition of Readiness 1..

      "context": "North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist allies; South Vietnam was supported by the United States, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies.. The war, considered a Cold War-era proxy war by some, lasted 19 years, with direct U.S. involvement ending in 1973, and included the Laotian Civil War and the Cambodian Civil War, resulting in all three countries becoming communist in 1975.. The conflict emerged from the First Indochina War against the communist-led Viet Minh.. Most of the funding for the French war effort was provided by the U.S. After the French quit Indochina in 1954, the US assumed financial and military support for the South Vietnamese state.. The Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng, also known as or \"NLF\" (the National Liberation Front), a South Vietnamese common front under the direction of North Vietnam, initiated a guerrilla war in the south.. North Vietnam had also entered Laos in the mid-1950s in support of insurgents, setting up the Ho Chi Minh trail to supply and reinforce the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng and increased in 1960.. U.S. involvement escalated under President John F. Kennedy through the MAAG program from just under a thousand in 1959 to 16,000 in 1963.. By 1963, the North Vietnamese had sent 40,000 soldiers to fight in South Vietnam.. North Vietnam was heavily backed by the People's Republic of China, which in addition to supplying arms as the USSR did, also sent hundreds of thousands of PLA servicemen to North Vietnam to serve in support roles.. By 1964, there were 23,000 US advisors in South Vietnam during the Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a U.S. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft.. In response, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authorization to increase U.S. military presence, deploying ground combat units for the first time and increasing troop levels to 184,000.. Past this point, the People's Army of Vietnam (known also as the NVA) engaged in more conventional warfare with US and South Vietnamese forces.. Every year onward there was significant build-up of US forces despite little progress, with Robert McNamara one of the principal architects of the war, expressing doubts of victory by the end of 1966.. U.S. and South Vietnam forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes.. The U.S. also conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam and Laos.. The Tet Offensive of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these doctrines as the NLF and PAVN mounted large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, turning US domestic support against the war.. The Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) expanded following a period of neglect after Tet, modeled on US doctrine.. The NLF sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive, losing over half its strength in a matter of months, which combined with subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, nearly wiped out the southern insurgency.. The CIA's Phoenix Program further degraded the NLF's membership and capabilities.. By the end of the year, the NLF insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations and necessitating increased use of NVA regulars from the north.. In 1969, North Vietnam declared a Provisional Revolutionary Government in South Vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced NLF a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as PAVN forces begun more conventional Combined arms warfare.. Operations crossed national borders: Laos was invaded by North Vietnam early on while Cambodia was used by North Vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through Cambodia began to be bombed by the U.S. in 1969, while the Laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964.. The deposition of the monarch Norodom Sihanouk by the Cambodian National Assembly resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country at the request of the Khmer Rouge, escalating the Cambodian Civil War and resulting in a U.S.-RVN counterinvasion.. After 1968, Nixon's policy of \"Vietnamization\", saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN with U.S. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment.. U.S. ground forces withdrew by late 1971, and U.S. involvement became limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments.. The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the largest and first mechanized PAVN offensive to date during the Easter Offensive of 1972, resulting in mutually heavy casualties, but failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult.. The Paris Peace Accords saw all US forces withdrawn and intervention prohibited by the US Congress on 15 August 1973 as a result of the Case\u2013Church Amendment.. The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for four years following the withdrawal of U.S. ground forces and two years following the withdrawal of the remaining U.S. forces, though U.S. material support continued at a much reduced rate.. The three-year period of 1972 to 1974 saw heavy fighting and constituted the war's bloodiest years for the ARVN.. The 1975 Spring Offensive culminated in the capture of Saigon by the PAVN in April 1975; this marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year.. The scale of fighting was enormous: by 1970 the ARVN was the world's fourth largest army, with the PAVN being similar in size at around a million regular soldiers.. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see Vietnam War casualties): estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million.. Some 275,000\u2013310,000 Cambodians, 20,000\u201362,000 Laotians, and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action.. The Sino-Soviet split re-emerged following the lull during the Vietnam War and conflict between North Vietnam and its Cambodian allies in the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea, and the newly-formed Democratic Kampuchea begun almost immediately in a series of border raids by the Khmer Rouge that erupted into the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War, with Chinese forces directly invading in the Sino-Vietnamese War and subsequent border conflicts..
