Instead, it only mentions the potential of populist extremist parties without linking it to the stability of Switzerland's democracy.\n10. Evaluate the overall similarity in meaning:\n- The candidate extraction does not accurately capture the full cause or the effect as stated in the reference extraction. Additionally, the relation in the candidate extraction changes the meaning from a positive enabler to a preventative measure.\n11. Conclusion:\n- The candidate extraction is not valid as it does not have the same meaning as the reference extraction. The cause is incomplete, the relation conveys a different meaning, and the effect does not match the reference effect."

    "chain": "1. **Identify the Components**: Start by identifying the cause, relation, and effect components in both the reference extraction and the candidate extraction.\n2. **Compare the Causes**: Check if the cause in the candidate extraction matches the cause in the reference extraction. The cause should be the same or convey the same meaning.\n3. **Compare the Relations**: Verify that the relation (the word or phrase that connects the cause and effect) in the candidate extraction is the same as in the reference extraction. The relation should indicate the same type of connection between cause and effect.\n4. **Compare the Effects**: Examine if the effect in the candidate extraction matches the effect in the reference extraction. The effect should be the same or convey the same meaning.\n5. **Evaluate the Overall Meaning**: Determine if the overall meaning of the candidate extraction is the same as the reference extraction. This means that the cause and effect relationship should be maintained and the implications should be identical.\n6. **Check for Consistency**: Ensure that there are no contradictions or significant details added or omitted in the candidate extraction that would change the meaning compared to the reference extraction.\n7. **Conclusion**: If the cause, relation, and effect components are the same or equivalent in meaning, and the overall relationship and implications are maintained, then the candidate extraction is valid.\nIn this case:\n- The cause in both extractions is \"switching to a different volume frequently requires overhauling the syllabus\".\n- The relation in both extractions is \"cause\".\n- The effect in both extractions is \"Professors often develop course curricula based on Wiley's textbook offerings (or use volumes they have authored themselves and published through Wiley)\".\n- The overall meaning of the candidate extraction is the same as the reference extraction.\nSince all components match and the overall meaning is preserved, the candidate extraction is valid, which is consistent with the evaluation result provided: Valid: 1."

    "chain": "1. **Identify the Cause in the Reference Extraction**: Look at the reference extraction and determine what is identified as the cause. In this case, the cause is \"the success of shows\".\n2. **Identify the Cause in the Candidate Extraction**: Examine the candidate extraction to see what is identified as the cause. Here, the cause is \"the success of shows such as Mad Men and The Walking Dead\".\n3. **Compare the Causes**: Check if the cause in the candidate extraction matches or is equivalent to the cause in the reference extraction. The candidate extraction includes specific examples of the shows, which provides additional detail but does not change the fundamental cause.\n4. **Identify the Relation in the Reference Extraction**: Determine the relation in the reference extraction. The relation given is \"enable\".\n5. **Identify the Relation in the Candidate Extraction**: Look for the relation in the candidate extraction. The relation here is \"cause\".\n6. **Compare the Relations**: Evaluate whether the relation in the candidate extraction conveys the same meaning as the relation in the reference extraction. The words \"enable\" and \"cause\" can be synonymous in this context, both indicating that the success of the shows led to the effect.\n7. **Identify the Effect in the Reference Extraction**: Note the effect in the reference extraction, which is \"The shift to original scripted content\".\n8. **Identify the Effect in the Candidate Extraction**: Observe the effect in the candidate extraction. It is also \"The shift to original scripted content\".\n9. **Compare the Effects**: Confirm that the effect in the candidate extraction is the same as in the reference extraction. They are identical.\n10. **Evaluate Overall Validity**: After comparing the cause, relation, and effect between the reference and candidate extractions, determine if they are equivalent in meaning. In this case, despite the candidate extraction providing a bit more detail in the cause, the overall meaning is preserved.\n11. **Conclusion**: Since the causes, relations, and effects are equivalent in meaning, the candidate extraction is valid compared to the reference extraction. The evaluation result is 1, indicating that the candidate extraction is valid."
