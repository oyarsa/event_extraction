    "chain": "1. Identify the cause in the reference extraction:\n- The reference extraction identifies \"this high-speed line substantially\" as the cause.\n2. Identify the effect in the reference extraction:\n- The reference extraction identifies \"reduces the attractiveness of Guangshen's existing through train\" as the effect.\n3. Identify the relation in the reference extraction:\n- The reference extraction uses the word \"cause\" to indicate the relation between the cause and effect.\n4. Compare the cause in the candidate extraction to the reference:\n- The candidate extraction identifies \"Taking around 50 minutes from Guangzhou to Hong Kong\" as the cause, which is different from the reference extraction.\n5. Compare the effect in the candidate extraction to the reference:\n- The candidate extraction has the same effect as the reference: \"this high-speed line substantially reduces the attractiveness of Guangshen's existing through train.\"\n6. Compare the relation in the candidate extraction to the reference:\n- The candidate extraction uses the same word \"cause\" to indicate the relation, which is consistent with the reference extraction.\n7. Evaluate the overall meaning:\n- Although the candidate extraction has the same effect and relation as the reference, the cause is different. The reference extraction focuses on the existence of the high-speed line as the cause, while the candidate extraction specifies the duration it takes for the high-speed line to travel from Guangzhou to Hong Kong as the cause.\n8. Determine the validity of the candidate extraction:\n- Since the cause in the candidate extraction does not match the cause in the reference extraction, the overall meaning is altered. The candidate extraction introduces a specific detail (the travel time) that is not present in the reference extraction's cause.\n9. Conclusion:\n- The candidate extraction is not valid compared to the reference extraction because it changes the cause, which affects the overall meaning of the cause-effect relationship. The evaluation result of \"Valid: 0\" is correct."
