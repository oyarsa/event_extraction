Analyze the answer: The answer given is \"the giraffe was not chained or otherwise restrained so it was able to move freely.\"\n4. Compare the answer with the context: The context does not explicitly mention whether the giraffe was chained or restrained.

Compare the answer to the context: The answer provided is \"the seller wanted more rubles than I had.\"\n6. Evaluate the correctness of the answer: The answer given does not directly address the question \"Why did I tell him?\" Instead, it states a fact about the seller's initial price demand, which is not the reason why the speaker told the seller about the currency they had.\n7.
