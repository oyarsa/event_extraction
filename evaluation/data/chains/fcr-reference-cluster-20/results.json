Here, the cause is \"the success of shows such as Mad Men and The Walking Dead\".\n3. **Compare the Causes**: Check if the cause in the candidate extraction matches or is equivalent in meaning to the cause in the reference extraction. The candidate extraction includes specific examples of the shows, which provides the same meaning as the reference extraction's more general statement.\n4. **Identify the Relation in the Reference Extraction**: Identify the relation in the reference extraction, which is \"enable\".\n5. **Identify the Relation in the Candidate Extraction**: Identify the relation in the candidate extraction, which is \"cause\".\n6. **Compare the Relations**: Determine if the relation in the candidate extraction conveys the same meaning as the relation in the reference extraction. The words \"enable\" and \"cause\" can be synonymous in this context, both indicating that the success of the shows led to the shift.\n7. **Identify the Effect in the Reference Extraction**: Look at the reference extraction to identify the effect, which is \"The shift to original scripted content\".\n8. **Identify the Effect in the Candidate Extraction**: Examine the candidate extraction to identify the effect. It is the same as in the reference: \"The shift to original scripted content\".\n9. **Compare the Effects**: Check if the effect in the candidate extraction matches or is equivalent in meaning to the effect in the reference extraction. In this case, they are identical.\n10. **Evaluate Overall Validity**: After comparing the causes, relations, and effects, determine if the candidate extraction maintains the same meaning as the reference extraction. Since the causes are equivalent, the relations are synonymous, and the effects are identical, the candidate extraction is valid.\nThe evaluation result is 1, which means the candidate extraction is valid when compared to the reference extraction."
