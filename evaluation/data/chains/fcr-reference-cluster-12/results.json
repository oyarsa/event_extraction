Compare the relations from both extractions.\n- The reference extraction uses \"enable\" to indicate that the cause leads to the effect of Switzerland being a stable democracy.\n- The candidate extraction uses \"prevent\" which indicates a stopping or hindering effect, but does not directly relate to the stability of the democracy.\n5.

Evaluate the overall meaning of both extractions.\n- The reference extraction clearly links the devolved, cantonal system of government's ability to limit extremist parties to the stability of Switzerland's democracy.\n- The candidate extraction does not make this link clear. It only states that the system prevents the potential of extremist parties without connecting it to the stability of the democracy.\n8. Determine the validity of the candidate extraction based on the comparison.\n- Since the candidate extraction does not capture the full cause, does not use a relation that implies the same outcome, and does not include the same effect as the reference extraction, it does not have the same meaning as the reference.\nEvaluation Result:\n- The candidate extraction is not valid (Valid: 0) because it does not convey the same cause-effect relationship as the reference extraction."
