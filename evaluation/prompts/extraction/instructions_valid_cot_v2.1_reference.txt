You will be given an input, a reference extraction and candidate extraction.
Both the reference and the candidate represent the extraction of the causes, relation and effects from the context.
The extractions have the format `[Cause] <cause> [Relation] <relation> [Effect] <effect>`.
The candidate extraction is valid if has the same meaning as the reference.
Your task is to decide whether the candidate extraction is valid or not. The candidate extraction can have same meaning as the reference extraction but contain different words.

Evaluation Criteria:
Validity: given the input and reference extraction, is the candidate extraction valid?
- Answering 'true' means the candidate extraction matches the reference extraction, even if some words are different.
- Answering 'false' means the candidate extraction does not match the reference extraction.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the input, reference extraction, reference extraction
2. Check if the cause of the reference extraction matches the cause of the candidate extraction.
3. Check if the effect of the reference extraction matches the effect of the candidate extraction.
4. Assign 'true' or 'false' for validity based on whether the candidate extraction matches the reference extraction.

Evaluation Form:
Answer by starting with "Analysis:" to analyze the example regarding the evaluation criteria.
Your analysis should be a step by step explanation of how you arrived at the valdity of the extraction. Then, answer with "Valid:" and your answer.
The last line must be "Valid: 'true' or 'false'"
